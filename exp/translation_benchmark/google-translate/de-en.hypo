The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I&#39;m a #PRS_ORG# major customer so it&#39;s not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what to include in the package so that you can track it as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and order again for the better price or is there another way to get a credit?
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on the role of parents for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a look, help out, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way they learn responsibility, help out in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children themselves, I don&#39;t see a problem.
If your K1 is busy on his own for a short time and he&#39;s OK with it, that&#39;s fine.
It&#39;s up to you to decide whether this is right for your children.
It&#39;s not like he&#39;s supposed to wrap K2 and accompany him to sleep for hours.
Legally, it&#39;s probably questionable.
Maybe that&#39;s where the psychologist&#39;s statement comes from.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but I can&#39;t think of the title anymore, maybe someone here knows about it...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by dousing himself with food and going to his big cats&#39; enclosure.
The case is taken over by a detective who, after a short investigation, gets in touch with his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The inspector has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned anonymously before each suicide to go to the scene of the suicide and document it and put the photos on the internet.
Anyway, it turns out that this therapist runs some kind of underground therapy group where the patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and the patients end up facing their fears in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to her death on purpose)
This facing of fear is called &quot;the fight&quot; in the book.
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That&#39;s the rough plot, I&#39;m quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If this plot is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh my, I don&#39;t have the wifi password available.
Have to contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 y., splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has splinters of wood under the thumbnail (outside) along the entire length.
Tried to pull him out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grab.
Didn&#39;t work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chances.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
With the combination of digital decoder and sound module on one printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any H0 and 0 gauge locomotive.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm &quot;sugar cube&quot; speaker and sound capsule assembly kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
It can handle the DCC data format just like Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are just as natural as 2 and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders register fully automatically with a suitable digital command station.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main track can be read out with the appropriate central units.
Auxiliary registers exist for command stations that can only program CVs from 1-255.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed steps with 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable 16 functions to be triggered.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol permits automatic registration with mfx®-compatible control panels.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® braking sections as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC braking modules or with direct current is also possible.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC automatic shuttle train enables automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC railways.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to promote booster vaccinations
Politics and science in Great Britain are getting more and more new omicron cases.
All qualifying adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer by the New Year.
London – British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress on the corona booster vaccinations than previously planned in view of the rapidly increasing number of omicrons.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year if at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday evening.
Previously, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the omicron variant, one is faced with an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
&quot;Get boosted now!&quot; Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1,239 more omicron cases were recorded in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, that was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
is the full amount refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I support everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today I received an email invitation to an interview.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately the name is not &quot;Peter&quot;, but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she is from a cultural background it&#39;s either male or female.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone help me please?
** I&#39;m a foreigner and don&#39;t want to step on officials&#39; feet.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have 5 books total.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn&#39;t work
The chair obviously had a defect that was not apparent when it was sold.
How else can such upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
Tried first on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working for approx.
14 days no more.
That&#39;s why I always bought the latest books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are back in stock and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order please and charge me for that.
[CW] That feeling when I can&#39;t help.
Content warning: I&#39;m going to write something about domestic violence in some detail here.
I just have to write something from my soul.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
A topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims cannot be helped or think we cannot help them.
I&#39;m well aware that we can&#39;t do everything and it&#39;s not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can&#39;t do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can&#39;t reach everyone.
I don&#39;t know what the reason is, maybe it&#39;s fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of snatching the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears myself, is that everyone is worth being able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don&#39;t just have to put up with violence.
I often wish I could help with that anyway...I know I can&#39;t.
But that never makes it easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
&quot;Arcane&quot; on Netflix: What is the series good for &quot;League of Legends&quot;?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: &quot;Arcane&quot;, the series from the &quot;League of Legends&quot; computer game universe, recently started on Netflix.
Why are we excited for the previously announced season two?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least the youngster Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, looking back on the cup defeat at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick said: &quot;We still have a little anger in our stomachs&quot;.
But that didn&#39;t subside after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball league.
Whereby the way of the performance was even more disappointing than the bare result.
A statistic should be mentioned as an example, which expresses the entire dilemma: The triple quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) in a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick gave the answer: &quot;We just weren&#39;t focused enough after the win at Tenerife and didn&#39;t do what we trained for.&quot;
To move the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted very differently: &quot;To win a great game against Ludwigsburg for the second time,&quot; said the happy coach.
&quot;It felt like in front of 10,000 people.&quot;
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money&#39;s worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer TJ Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team&#39;s game.
&quot;The best playmaker I&#39;ve ever coached,&quot; said Gleim.
While in Patrick&#39;s team even top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and closed the gap to eight points after being 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Luckily there isn&#39;t much time to quarrel.
Already on Wednesday (7 p.m.) the giants welcome the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We informed ourselves legally again and therefore wrote to you again.
We originally got in touch six months ago.
Always as if peeled from the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program &quot;Guten Tag,liebes Glück&quot; - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - &quot;by official order&quot; to contain the corona virus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season also have to be canceled for the time being, as stated on the website of the singer, who will be 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to catch up on their dates that were already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot and enjoyed singing even as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received many awards.
His live album from the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; series (2019) - just like his successful album &quot;Für Frauen ist das kein Problem&quot; (2013) - reached second place in the charts.
He made it out of the niche and into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with his blond hair combed back and etiquette in mind, Max Raabe has become an integral part of the current German-speaking music scene.
He has been on tour with the program &quot;Guten Tag,liebes Glück&quot; since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be complemented with existing furniture and so we could check beforehand whether it matches the color
It still doesn&#39;t work I can only scroll the cover page but not.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new federal building minister, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing groups, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
&quot;With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes,&quot; said Geywitz in an interview with the &quot;Tagesspiegel&quot; (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the years to come.
Incidentally, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, &quot;we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps,&quot; emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I realized that I forgot the last step of the payment.

This is an absolute disgrace
Tornado kills at least 100 in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
Several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the United States on Saturday night and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms left a 200-mile swath of destruction in their wake, mostly in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had blown through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It&#39;s hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are increasing every hour.
Hello, I just saw that showcase #NAME# is sold out.
That&#39;s too bad.
Is it still in production?
Or has it been taken out of the range altogether?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
until when do you register?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the blanket that is in the shopping cart now and have it delivered to Germany?
I had returned an item or submitted a return using the contact form and wanted to ask whether it arrived or was being processed, as I had not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash premiums for vaccination.
They are in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - based on the German model - should also increase the willingness to receive corona vaccinations.
He switched to a company he slandered about.
That doesn&#39;t make his situation any better than yours.
Just wait and see.
It&#39;s been a year.
He obviously didn&#39;t sew himself into his old position and looked for something else.
You can too.
And that he didn&#39;t like you back then: well, it doesn&#39;t matter.
He didn&#39;t like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I&#39;m making a screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Greetings from Boron!
I&#39;m currently leading the adventure Across the Griffin Pass for a group of 4 friends and I want to seamlessly take my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I&#39;m in the process of writing the introductory adventure and stumble over my own feet at the very first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a cart of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
From there, the further action should develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins are supposed to ambush the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the ability to resolve the confrontation in a variety of ways: persuade, act, threaten, anticipate the danger, whatever the players can think of.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 with bows and sabers
If you don&#39;t notice, the goblins ambush the heroes in a ravine and flank the carriage in groups of three armed with bows, while two stop the carriage with spears.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all unconscious and then found and healed by the mayor&#39;s son, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. If a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the heroes&#39; aid in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think the deus ex machina of Solution 2 is?
Is the encounter too much as a start to the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later, so it&#39;s not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I wasn&#39;t expecting so many replies, especially so many great suggestions and tips.
I&#39;m guaranteed to take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narratives again.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put back together.
Sadly it still does not work.
So I would still like to send them back
Can you then send me the return receipts, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I&#39;m fed up with Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season the quality on German Sky has continued to decline, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, the transmission was cut off in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the schedule was far behind schedule due to the delayed start and the accident at the start, the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) could still have been shown.
Apparently, however, F1 has priority for legal reasons and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes did a good job of covering the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident.
Then the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher were again ignorant of the rules in F1, so neither of them knew that you can change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen should be allowed to change the tires when there were radio messages to Hamilton on the subject.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that Verstappen had this opportunity.
I believe that such elementary rules should be known when commenting on F1 on a pay TV station.
It&#39;s also not the first guesswork as to what is now possible or required by the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties about the rules.
In general, I don&#39;t like Roos&#39; artificial commentary style, but I admit that it&#39;s a matter of taste.
But seriously, I even like RTL&#39;s Heiko Wasser better.
In addition, there are constant silliness that make both of them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or &quot;UuuuuHD&quot; by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which he obviously doesn&#39;t take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-out lap Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV because only the German soundtrack has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two broadcasters also do less advertising in the training courses than Sky, and that as free TV broadcasters.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1&#39;s programming is also very poor and full of reruns.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language channel that broadcasts F1.
Apart from the advertising, RTL does a better job in the four races that they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn&#39;t arrived.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it will be sent out on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them broke after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lift.
We offer this series in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect several air vents.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, but depending on the model, fan pumps are also ideal for setting an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a decor that draws out the air bubbles convert to a function.
A treasure chest, shell or something similar would be mentioned here.
The MK series has a special, soundproof construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an air vent or similar using a 4/6 mm air hose...and you&#39;re ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and mounted outside.
If the fan pump sits lower than the water level, you should put a non-return valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent, if water were to run backwards, that the water would run out of the pool through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The MK series pumps are pure powerhouses that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time here on ebay as 3 days, packing is done every day and the packages are also picked up here every day.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take precautions a little so that nobody gets upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be like that, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the forwarding business... of course no Corona stops here.
Please do not rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, one likes to scold these services, even if we say at the moment...they have it damn hard
This also varies greatly from region to region.
Don&#39;t be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that better times will come again.
how long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos&#39; Blue Origin rocket system &quot;New Shepard&quot;.
The flight, which lasted around ten minutes, took off and landed in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos himself received the newly crowned astronauts upon their return.
&quot;Welcome back,&quot; Bezos said, clad in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled in 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor at the company , the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not say how much they paid for their tickets.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father&#39;s mission.
He worked hard on his assignments and had to do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space again, said the moderator.
&quot;New Shepard&quot; flies up to 100 kilometers altitude
The missile system &quot;New Shepard&quot; flies largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the limit to space, but there is no binding international rule.
It was Blue Origin&#39;s third manned space flight: the first, in July, had Amazon founder Bezos himself on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second, in October, included 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, best known for his role as Captain Kirk on Star Trek, former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Deputy CEO by Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of promoting the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I&#39;m currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting in itself, and standing in the laboratory doesn&#39;t bother me either (I&#39;ve already completed the inorganic chemistry internship).
Of course, I found out about career prospects before I started my studies, but I also thought at the time that I would definitely like to and will study until I do my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have my doubts, and I am particularly depressed about the job prospects.
On the one hand (study check, etc.) you keep hearing about great job opportunities and the job is totally wanted, on the other hand you keep hearing about unemployed biologists and unbelievably badly paid jobs.
So I&#39;m really interested in:
1) What are you currently working as?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What did you study/ what training did you do?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your answers!
I&#39;m really unsure at the moment and am considering dropping out of my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, please let me know :)
Extra stress before holidays &amp; bank holiday weekends
This topic came up for me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
Therefore only now a post to it.
It&#39;s not just before long holidays, like the Christmas holidays, that we have a lot of stress in our company.
Apparently there&#39;s also before public holidays plus bridging days.
It was like this: Last week was Assumption Day, which we call &quot;Ascension Day&quot; in Switzerland.
Most people and companies have a bridging day on Friday, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend coming up last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of e-mails that absolutely had to be sent out before Ascension, order here, order there, all *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because &quot;next week then&quot; sounds like so much time and that shouldn&#39;t be?
Or because people seriously want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, I was also really annoyed.
What is this self-hostage about holidays?
Why do we still have public holidays if we can&#39;t really treat ourselves to them?!
Mind you, the stress didn&#39;t come from above, all of the colleagues were on their own.
My question is simple: is it just us, the Swiss?
Is that our Reformed Evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn&#39;t got any presents yet.
&quot;The nice thing is that even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest,&quot; said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the mood for the festival by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
&quot;I love that,&quot; Catterfeld said.
But she still has a lot to do before the contemplative days: &quot;For the first time I don&#39;t have any presents yet, I finally have to get started&quot;.
NEKTON-Bio supports smooth moulting and new plumage formation.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in bird husbandry can be traced back exclusively to incorrect nutrition.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
The composition of NEKTON-Bio explicitly takes into account and balances the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered while using NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold-water soluble and can easily be administered via the drinking water or the soft feed.
Thank you I found it
Unfortunately still not working
GDR handwork model old building E-locomotive E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway company ME Issue 11/1968, used with signs of wear and missing parts, see photos, function well, the class E 95 is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal block trains in the Silesian network, the kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and is being worked up to be operational
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to haul 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The top speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG ordered the delivery of the 1&#39;Co+Co1&#39; locomotive with AEG suspension drive and the delivery of the mechanical part, and the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given road numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of what later became the GDR.
In 1946 the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn repair shop in Dessau, it was determined that all six locomotives were worth working up.
[4] As the re-electrification of the Central German network increased, the need for locomotives for heavy freight train service increased and the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in large numbers, were the first to be built.
Only when it became clear that the number of refurbishments of the E 94 could not be increased any further did the E 95 become the focus of the refurbishment.
[4]Initially, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They came to the Halle P depot in 1960.
They were used in their own schedule, mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic with increasing age.
It often happened that contactors got stuck during switching operations.
Then the attendant who was constantly riding on this locomotive had to release the contactor with a hammer and wooden wedge while the train was in motion.
Damage to the traction motors was common and led to months of locomotive failure.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electrical operations was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so that the E 95 was decommissioned.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to man electric locomotives with one man, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the difficulties mentioned with the machines and the visibility from the driver&#39;s cab.
[5] After road numbers E 95 02 and E 95 03 were shut down in mid-1969, they were followed by road number E 95 01, which left service on October 5, 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a point heating system at Halle main station.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external work on the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986 the interior of the locomotive was completed.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive is looked after as a museum.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintwork, the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Schlesische Bergbahn and the branching branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handcrafted model H0 in the original packaging, works well, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary, dusty, with signs of wear, cellar smell !!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - the kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and signs of storage.
Yes, the F-parts are
I received a bed from you.
However, there was a problem with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet...unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can&#39;t make up the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately incorrectly produced.
The center beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I get new ones sent.
When are they going to be sent out?
no no flat.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn&#39;t matter.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose
For me they are not flat
Can I have this sent to you?
Hello #NAME#, do you want me to explain the problem again?
House fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, there was an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, but the police did not assume that the fire was intentionally set.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But that arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping again
To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the LinkedIn social network
Biontech boss Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur has now published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
A friend&#39;s illness prompted him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the corona virus.
There was false information on social media that I was supposedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine,&quot; Sahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
&quot;For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counter these false rumours.&quot;
So far he has refused because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: &quot;I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid 19 disease and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He didn&#39;t ask why.
&quot;However, the most common cause appears to be fear, often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.&quot;
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, so sometimes it&#39;s better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
&quot;I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself,&quot; Sahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany when vaccinating the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has long been lifted - and according to the Biontech boss, he has had himself vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without power
The lights went out in several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
Due to the fire, the lights went out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several communities.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely resolved in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers from THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called on neighbors to help.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts,&quot; said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, since the Westnetz fitters were initially only able to temporarily put some lines back into operation, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out around 7:15 p.m. on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is required there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since 6 p.m. on Saturday, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 9.30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., those last affected by the outage have also had electricity.
Over 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were on duty.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighborhood help.
&quot;It is now important that the citizens take care of the elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire department if help is needed,&quot; said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of old people&#39;s homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need medical devices that depend on electricity or who are dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
But I can&#39;t mount the base on the tabletop.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions.
We wanted the ones with tabletop diameters of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
My #PRS_ORG# arrived today, but I can&#39;t nest them and shorten them.
Can you help me there?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate feedback
yes it really is easier!
Then we do it like that!
can you send me the return slip by email?
the repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, before the purchase I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We don&#39;t agree with that
Nordic Combined: Combined Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo was once again beaten by the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country ski run with a large lead after ski jumping.
Return order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made new s and are using version 4.5...
it could be that you have heard about problems before
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it I get the message, oops!
This document could not be opened.
File may be corrupt, contact customer service.
As far as I can tell it&#39;s a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone, what now?
I have to work from time to time too!
To ensure that the paint is applied evenly and cleanly, you should clean the components from dust, grease and fingerprints with a little soapy water, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you bring the brush to the model with a new color for the first time, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components, which will no longer be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly, line by line.
Slight overlapping of the paint layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid quick sweeping back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
Otherwise the dark ones could show through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise unsightly metal streaks can occur if they mix with normal colors.
Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve a true-to-original appearance with the decals.
From national emblems on aircraft to ship names to decorative strips and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still within easy reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued on more easily before it is built into the fuselage.
Time, patience and a steady hand are even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks.
Cut out each required decal individually and lay them out for yourself.
Decals are also called water slide decals because you briefly moisten their back with water until the backing paper turns dark from the wetness.
Then you slide the picture just a small piece off the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also moistened beforehand).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away to the side.
Attention: Always check whether the picture is sitting correctly before you slide it completely off the paper so that it doesn&#39;t stick to your finger, crease or even tear.
Soak up excess water with a kitchen towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I stop reading the book and have to log out and log in and load the book again and find where I&#39;ve read from.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this via email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
ok thanks anyway!
then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility treatment with PKV / What is an &quot;insured case&quot;?
Hello everyone,
we were in fertility treatment for a while, now when it comes to billing with private health insurance, it suddenly gets in the way.
Sequentially:
We had applied for fertility treatment from the PKV in advance and received approval for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child and made 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet settle these with the PKV.
We applied again for the PKV to cover the costs and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we carried out more tests than promised, logically we bill the most expensive ones with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wanted 3 reimburse attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the other 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second desire to have children is a new insurance case.
According to the General Terms and Conditions, however, &quot;The insured event begins with the treatment and ends when there is no longer any need for treatment.&quot;
The questions for the experts in the group here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or we (there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed)?
* Should the private health insurer have pointed out to us in the promises that further attempts expire after a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insured event?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here gave their opinions.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again
In order.
We won&#39;t be ordering anything from them again.
If you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address) you obviously lost good customers.
Feel free to pass this on to your manager.
That&#39;s not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague said to me that the repayment has been arranged and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
It&#39;s not my fault that the chest of drawers arrives completely disturbed
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote
It clearly states that the refund has been issued and I still haven&#39;t received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various pieces of furniture for our apartment via his account.
We won&#39;t do that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Irrespective of this, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cupboard and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools that can be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them in your shop.
Can you help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
There is no general definition with exact budget limits as to what a low-budget film is.
Wikipedia has this to say about it:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
One can find plenty of lists of low budget movies on the web, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it?
And what do you perhaps not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to inquire about the best price on the Odelle gray leather sofa.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this also reliable now?
Thanks very much
Best regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I&#39;ll give up again soon because it just doesn&#39;t work here.
Hello
&quot;Half victory&quot; against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a &quot;half victory&quot; in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
But the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus&#39; border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU did not resolve the confrontation in the long term, explained the researcher at the Berlin Science and Politics Foundation (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not giving in completely, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
Dealing with the people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Apparently there is an &quot;increasing normalization of pushbacks&quot; by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed to this, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens the cohesion in the Union.
&quot;Apparently, it can&#39;t assert itself when a member state gets it in its head to do its thing,&quot; as is currently the case in Poland, which doesn&#39;t even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
According to Bossong, the EU is also paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus: A basic agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line &quot;border protection, border protection, border protection&quot; has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to Poland&#39;s border guards, migrants have tried again to get into Polish territory via Belarus.
A spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday that 55 migrants had been arrested on Sunday night and taken back to the border.
During the incident not far from the town of Czeremsza, the Polish officials were thrown at by the migrants with stones.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
The border guard registered a total of 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers on Friday evening.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the people&#39;s countries of origin to prevent departures from there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
&quot;The EU threw its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.&quot;
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen broke two rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two breaches of the rules in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second appeal was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed according to the rules.
Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman overtook cars in front of him.
I will check this.
I&#39;ll speak to the bank and get back to you
thanks for the support
Free entry for members: Europa-Park organizes SC Freiburg fan day
Europa-Park, which gave its name to the Europa-Park stadium of Sport-Club Freiburg, invited to the SC Freiburg fan day.
As announced by the park, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were able to visit Europa-Park free of charge on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausage.
The roller coaster trains shone red and white through the jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and lots of red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop,&quot; says the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
The first SC Freiburg fan day at Europa-Park once again showed how well the partnership fits.
Seeing beaming fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms that,&quot; says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is that €#NUMBER# and not the original €1699?
Stages in the career of the new world champion Verstappen
Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new Formula 1 world champion.
Max Verstappen did it.
In his seventh year in Formula 1, the Dutchman won his first world title in the Red Bull.
His way to the top of the premier class:
Abu Dhabi - 2012, Italy: Verstappen gambled away the Kart World Championship after a crash in Sarno.
Father Jos Verstappen angrily leaves him at a gas station on the return journey.
His mother Sophie Kumpen collects the teenager in the following car.
2014, England: Red Bull&#39;s junior team has promising youngsters in Verstappen.

Back then I had #NUMBER# a lot of trouble with you when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# chest of drawers.
Judith Hermann read from her novel &quot;Daheim&quot;
As part of the &quot;LiteraTour Nord&quot; reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel &quot;Daheim&quot; in the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the noises on her doorstep at night.
I submitted the contact form to return an item yesterday, but did not receive an email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your crazy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix and not all of our household.
Contact Mrs #NAME#.
I can&#39;t chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Ms. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a new order for the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This e-mail has not yet arrived.
The package wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.

Sorry but just because he says he&#39;s not an anti-Semite doesn&#39;t mean anything.
It&#39;s like when a afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Both of them won&#39;t admit their i&#39;s.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Yes wow then you are just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution as a matter of principle is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a god set the whole thing in motion.
But once you&#39;re a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just spouting nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically free of distortion and chromatic aberration right up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often marked with magnification information.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to observe the information in the &quot;Technical data&quot; table (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including folding magnifiers.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
If the optimal conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many strange situations when selling fir trees.
Once a man is said to have gone home without his partner because the two could not come to an agreement.
Every year he plants a good 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many strange situations.
That always makes the run-up to Christmas a little fun, he says.
And what about the voucher?
Otherwise I&#39;m gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We need not discuss which dish is better here, but there is a certain resemblance between the two.
Both consist of meat grilled on a rotating spit.
And that&#39;s why they both got their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like &quot;Schneller&quot;, which doesn&#39;t sound nearly as tasty.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wifi network.
Before that I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit flawlessly apart from a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and this also arrives at the DLan module that is connected to the FritzBox.
However, the full 500 don&#39;t arrive at the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, but the further away I go in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc .rooms away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here too.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is &quot;lost&quot; over the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
I&#39;m really desperate, which is why I created an extra account here.
So I would be more than happy to get an answer.
When it&#39;s time to switch checking accounts
Anyone who would have thought that the checking accounts would be calm for the time being would be wrong.
While many banks used the autumn to use all sorts of tricks to get their customers to confirm past fee increases, the exemptions for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quartered it for the overnight allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank division - to EUR 50,000 for current and investment accounts and to EUR 25,000 for call money accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for &quot;newly made individual agreements with existing customers&quot;.
Commerzbank had previously dropped to a limit of EUR 50,000, which still applies, as does ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to EUR 50,000 and now to EUR 25,000.
After all: According to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer advice centers, which even got a right against this regulation in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court.
The banks are already discussing whether the institutes should possibly make provisions - in the event that the higher authorities also declare the negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the forefront of Hollywood.
But her life is like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the &quot;Friends&quot; reunion and the continuation of her series &quot;The Morning Show,&quot; this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their looks.
After all, Aniston says, she treats herself to one chip a day (yes, you read that right: ONE chip out of the bag).
It&#39;s actually a miracle that she wins the hearts of female and male fans alike.
Maybe because she&#39;s just unlucky with luck - and is still looking for great love.
And crossed off the wish to have a baby from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people asking this have no idea what&#39;s wrong with me personally, medically why I can&#39;t.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will also bring happiness.
Unworthy end of a career: Raikkonen has to give up
Kimi Raikkonen&#39;s departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That&#39;s it.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the railings, Raikkonen had to park his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix less than halfway through the race.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, and the &quot;Iceman&quot; ended his career in the premier class of motorsport.
His wife Minttu and their two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Raikkonen&#39;s greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He managed 21 Grand Prix victories, 18 pole starts and 103 podium finishes. dpa
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
&quot;I did the math, I would have to win nine and a half per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026,&quot; said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who had two wins in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First on Saturday he fended off Johannes Lochner&#39;s attack by five hundredths, going from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material settings and on Sunday he opened up a larger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed over Brit Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
&quot;We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded,&quot; said Friedrich, who also clinched his 22nd win in a row.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, driving for Stuttgart, came fifth this time after second place.
After fourth place in the first race, Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth.
&quot;If I knew what he did differently, I would do it that way,&quot; Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamaica
In the women&#39;s bobsleigh, Laura Nolte clinched her third win of the season on her home track.
After only finishing fourth in monobob the day before, she raced to victory in the German triple success with brakewoman Deborah Levi on Sunday.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen finished second with Germany&#39;s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she notched up her first podium finish this winter.
Wiesbaden native Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool for me, first podium in the World Cup, I&#39;m super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
I&#39;m super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay,&quot; said Burghardt, emphasizing: &quot;It&#39;s not just pushing, there&#39;s also a lot to do around it&quot;.
Jamanka was a little annoyed that the rides were not entirely flawless, but said: &quot;It&#39;s going in the right direction&quot;.
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just didn&#39;t receive it and therefore couldn&#39;t redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to Corona I had completely different problems last year and never had time for them.
And now it says it has expired, which annoys me a lot.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order again since it is currently on sale :)
Why is shipping only on 16.3. started?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Was picked up by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly shipped goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one
And don&#39;t cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe one or the other feels the same way...
I&#39;m 24, have cPTSD, a full-time student and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn&#39;t cry or go to kindergarten, he&#39;s actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (dating 6yrs) is ill, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is in therapy now).
I visited him yesterday because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand is bandaged because of a burn).
On top of that, he has a cold and we see each other less (1-2x a week) at the moment, which bothers me a lot with my need for affection and love.
My little dog just had a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he&#39;s lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother and she has just been away for a month.
Now we also have housework to do, which of course we split up.
But cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD illness has been adjusted quite well at the moment, I&#39;m being treated reasonably well and I&#39;m coping.
Not well, but I&#39;m coping and I&#39;m almost symptom-free.
My university is asking a lot right now (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven&#39;t done anything yet and the day after tomorrow an anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is on my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it&#39;s the weekend.
But then it all goes on?
Just until my birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I&#39;m just so stressed right now that I need these mental cues, because otherwise I won&#39;t get it.
Somehow I feel guilty and &quot;chaotic&quot;, but I can&#39;t do it any other way...
Do you feel the same?
Honestly, I&#39;m eternally grateful that I don&#39;t have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can&#39;t even put it into words.
Don&#39;t know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think that partly has something to do with the mental load of women and that&#39;s why I thought that I would definitely find fellow sufferers here...
In any case, I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole color is different plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
When it was first delivered, the color was exactly as it was on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we swap tables now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th #NUMBER#.
Otherwise twice.
But it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed at school back then that many religion teachers didn&#39;t believe in God and that for them it was just another subject like math or geography.
It was always a bit strange for me, maybe also because I was brought up as a Christian and somehow I always believed that way.
What&#39;s your opinion?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
Is there a curriculum etc.
But would also just find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn&#39;t believe in the theory of relativity.
Then what makes you want to teach religion if you don&#39;t believe it?
preserve culture or something?
Hope you question is not too private.
Can&#39;t it be changed or not? I like to write in English, I understand that well
That&#39;s a long time, then I would refrain from it
It&#39;s fine, thanks.
I expect a response as soon as possible, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thanks for your support #NAME#.
Movie search Help please
Hello dear people,
I&#39;m looking for a film from my childhood (I&#39;m 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
Second, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite sure).
Since I can&#39;t describe it anyway, in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and a plot emerges.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live, I mean.
I believe the transition is also the burial place of the soldier.
In the end both soldiers fight each other I think.
If that means something to you, I&#39;m grateful for every answer.
Our little one only slept on her stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax yourself.
A child like that can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything around is right, no stuffed animals, go in and have a look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That&#39;s driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn&#39;t have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it straighten up a bit from the stomach?
Or is it face first right in the mattress?
From this you can deduce whether everything is in order.
We all grew up and when my husband was born it was common practice, for example, to lay the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already &quot;regular customers&quot; with you and have already bought many items
But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no reply.
It&#39;s about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The closet is currently not usable.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It&#39;s just that the politics of this station is now a mess.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then at the same time go on a big begging spree.
It was said to be an &quot;independent&quot; Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: We don&#39;t want to be &quot;a running advertising pillar&quot;.
What are you now?
A run-of-the-mill advertising station trying to get its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah&#39;s Do&#39;s &amp; Don&#39;ts.
Which of course apply to everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
Of course they can continue to insult people.
A Krogman who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the rented rooms exploded.
How are you supposed to find all of this?
Great if you like it, I think it&#39;s awful.
I would like to call you back because my wooden table was delivered defective.
Body breakage due to damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for a stomach ache or just to cuddle - My little warmth friend can be used in many ways.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional household remedy for soothing heat applications, since cherry pits absorb heat very well and release it again in doses.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes it particularly pleasant to use, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is only suitable as a heat pad for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for an unusual odour, mildew or burn marks and dispose of them immediately if there are any.
Please take the inner pillow out of the cover to warm it up first!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (observe the microwave manufacturer&#39;s instructions!)
Immediately after heating, shake the heat evenly throughout the pillow!
Then put the inner cushion back in the cover.
During the first warming up, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
It is essential that you follow the heating instructions given, since longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burns!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that the manufacturer&#39;s instructions allow heating grain products.
After the heated inner pillow has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on the crook of your arm!
Do not use the pillow in the case of acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory problems, fresh bruises, bruises and open wounds, and in people with reduced sensitivity to pain.
If you have existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases or if you are pregnant, please consult a doctor before use.
If the seams have opened and loose cores emerge, immediately dispose of the product and the loose cores and keep them out of the reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under the age of 1 year, the child&#39;s temperature should be checked regularly during use to rule out overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country where the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30°C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie second - Pauli WINS in Dusseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table cellar.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt under the third coach either.
Cheering in Darmstadt after the late win in the top game, joy in Hanover about interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was sufficient for operation.
Nothing, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply being plugged in.
I then removed the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can&#39;t I use the laptop in mains operation?
Is there something else broken?
Many thanks for your help!
I want the #PRS_ORG# delivered to my room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
Don&#39;t know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still have a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
With a capacity of 20 litres, even larger photo equipment can easily be swallowed up, which can be safely stowed away using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what other everyday objects you need stays well organized and can be separated from the photo equipment thanks to practical access points in the individually configurable interior.
With the “update” of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also has a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and still allow access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works in two ways: First, conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with messenger bags.
There is a metal hook in the closure flap with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different “levels”: there are 4 anchor bars, riveted in a stable manner, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
The backpack can also be closed reliably without snapping the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zip opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional top access backpacks - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the day-to-day suitability of the backpack enormously: if you take not only your photo equipment with you, but also everyday objects or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus easily store both separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of your body, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday things stay safely in the left half of the backpack and don&#39;t get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable shoulder straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents stay dry even if you head to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately I wait in vain for the email from their support.

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 1/12/21.
I received a completely different lamp than what I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And I couldn&#39;t have guessed that the past year was different than expected and I wasn&#39;t able to redeem and clarify it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don&#39;t accept that.

On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is based on the balancing of the disc according to the properties of the original assembly.
Discs made in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the cuts improve cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned windows underline the character of every car with an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man spotted glowing boulders in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Though he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly, sparking what became known as the &quot;California Gold Rush&quot; of &#39;49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country&#39;s wealth.
For many it was “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will pan for gold, recruit workers, herd horses and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You must outperform your fellow pioneers to avoid going broke with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to economize on your resources and set up a tableau that “works” more and more for you (so-called “engine building”).
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma is set over a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will stealthily and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most Pioneers, it will be banned!
This deactivates one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions such as harvesting resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers will return.
The Promoter rotates to a new location at the start of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout where players have to defend Coloma from an incursion of angry bandits.
When players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they get lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!
In the case of free shipping, up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm, I will use the shipping method, consignment (games wrapped in foil).
Everything else is mostly DPD insured and with tracking (games wrapped in foil, wrapped with fleece and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also send a box in a box for an additional charge of 2 euros, so that there are 100% no pressure points.
&quot;Why children are not tyrants&quot; Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological abuse, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary popped up on my Twitter timeline today and I watched it right away.
&gt;The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book &quot;Why Our Children Become Bullies&quot; (2008), he sparked a heated debate about education.
Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
​Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible persons should never, never, never! go for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and is possible in the situation.
Brrr, I&#39;m still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries are advising on the elimination of the test requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the federal states want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the test requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times.
&quot;We countries need clarity quickly as to whether and when the obligation to test can be dropped for those who have been vaccinated three times,&quot; said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the health ministers&#39; conference, of the &quot;Bild am Sonntag&quot;.
The elimination of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is &quot;not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive,&quot; said Holetschek.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised “that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers next Tuesday”. − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What&#39;s the best way to go about it?
Hello, I really like the #PRS_ORG# chair, but I can&#39;t see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make a purchase using my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error has occurred.
Purchasing via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What can be the reason?
What you describe is referred to as *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approx. 1 in 1000.
Hearing noises/voices is the most common, seeing images is less common, and the perception of pain is the least common.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anesthetic is avoided to protect the child until the umbilical cord is removed.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anaesthetic interview.
Certain anesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine describes awareness correctly, but** u/Nitemarex **didn&#39;t have any by definition.
I misread your comment.
But the chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the €20 doesn&#39;t help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the area of e-commerce.
Please check again whether you can at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We lose a lot of money there.
I have already sent you an email which you have not answered.
The question again.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told they only deliver to your doorstep - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don&#39;t know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor for me.
won&#39;t I be called?
I formulated a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has made a name for himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later he wrote a monumental theater history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
The new book is still lying on the table, hot off the press: &quot;An old man is getting older&quot;.
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: &quot;I give my thanks here.&quot;
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as load carriers in Europe.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria each year is not recorded

Roulade Tips &amp; Tricks
A week ago I got a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash here.
We had this for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery tender!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I&#39;ve got a taste for it and would like to cook roulades for the first time on New Year&#39;s Eve.
Tomorrow I&#39;ll prepare a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don&#39;t have an oven, just a large pot.
What&#39;s next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn&#39;t that good anymore, but I can manage
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already on 18.01. informed by email that the refund has been made.
But to date I have not received the money.
Would you please check there.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck are part of the Christmas season, like the Christmas tree and presents.
Haven&#39;t bought any poultry yet?
Time is running out now.
We&#39;ll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The &quot;drive&quot; of a tube power amp is a major contributor to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amp sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls you can set the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control that allows you to lower the sound level without changing the gain and distortion.
It was already mentioned above that the POWER LEVEL control can even be used to boost a power reserve when things get outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in every situation.
The headphone socket can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently &quot;acoustic&quot; sound impression even when using headphones or when recording directly.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket, so you can jam along with your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don&#39;t need a separate tuner.
If you also treat yourself to a VFS5 footswitch, you can also easily call up the sounds with your foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and &quot;tap&quot; the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I saw that with others.
Is it possible for you to send the lamp back?
As it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me further?
And the dresser?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat in the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;d be happy with a discount or voucher.
Maybe I can find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods that I don&#39;t need is a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hooks.
That&#39;s not a satisfactory answer and it wasn&#39;t worth the wait

Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
According to Iranian information, progress is being made in the negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement.
&quot;Both sides are about to agree on the issues that should be on the agenda,&quot; Iran&#39;s chief negotiator, Ali Bagheri, told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a &quot;positive and important development&quot; because initially there was not even agreement on the issues to be discussed.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
The talks in Vienna to revive the agreement continued on Thursday after an interruption of almost a week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with the highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
The value is the only federal state above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia was the only federal state with a corona incidence above the 1000 mark on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had recently had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia fell slightly, but was also above 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated in intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and can hardly keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will not be until the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and hand it in at the post office, that&#39;s it, right?
I don&#39;t have to click/specify/fill in anything else here?
That&#39;s exactly what I want to avoid, that&#39;s why I&#39;m writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return shipment at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my opinion a cheek.
It is time for changes
###MBundestag Greetings, I&#39;m u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the Bundestag over the past few months, you can see one thing: it doesn&#39;t exist.
We got into a state of hibernation and extended the summer slump to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, it&#39;s probably just a matter of dissatisfaction with how some things have gone here and how we&#39;re doing in general.
In the last few days, there has been an increasing impression that many here are still really interested in the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is in demand, which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in the last few days and, to put it simply, found it a shambles.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community found themselves interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would like to once again expressly call on everyone to participate, as this is the only way this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the Bundestag work in the future?
* Which existing regulations need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How should we appear to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair voting system?
I&#39;m pretty sure I forgot a few things, but that&#39;s okay, we have the discord for that at the end.
If you have the time and inclination, join the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that will be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/chunky for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this as I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this gets returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in oversize, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# has to be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I&#39;m asking you to do it now.
I don&#39;t have suitable packaging, but I will dismantle the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up appointment.
Are there instructions for assembly?
How long would I have to get them or decide to send them back?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague who I like very much.
She herself used to be a vegetarian for a while, but currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before that.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without thinking too much.
Namely, that for a long time I thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately also supporting animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to go vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that displeasure arose on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian you reduced animal suffering.
Now I&#39;m wondering if my answer was too clumsy?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without you wanting to.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be there on the assigned date that #PRS_ORG# will pick up my return.
Unfortunately, since I can&#39;t be there because of a funeral, that can&#39;t be changed either.
Can I be given an alternative collection time, please?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found again all the time.
Lahnstein weir equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros subsidy from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented Lord Mayor Peter Labonte with a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment truck of the Lahnstein volunteer fire brigade in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important security investment.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this,&quot; says Lahnstein&#39;s Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment truck is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, increasing use is expected in the long term: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle and the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river are contributing to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of the time and then the problems started.
I can&#39;t open the book.
Followed their recommendations but synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I&#39;m a little frustrated because the whole campaign has already cost me a lot of time and now I&#39;m hoping for help.
OK, that&#39;s how it is then.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter an appointment during the ordering process?

First of all, thank you for facing the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar job, i.e. we were also weapon bearers in the executive branch, I don’t want to go into it any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be very simplified.
Basically, one should say that of course the civil servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
It should also be clear to everyone that, of course, people right from the conservative side are magically attracted to the uniform and those who wear weapons, and that these people then naturally find it difficult to deal with the reality they live in. Of course, it is also clear, because in addition to the average white man, you now have many Germans with you Migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I don&#39;t mean the exaggeratedly feminine clichéd gays, because there are fewer or none of them in the executive branch, but completely normal men and women who you don&#39;t notice if they don&#39;t tell you) and also on I can and must rely on these people, because in case of doubt they will save your life or use it for you.
But these fringe groups also represent a conservative attitude, even if it sounds strange at first in my experience, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less offended by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if these politics supposedly support them or think they are right to do, they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since the police and armed forces are of course also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wing people there, but the fact that they are openly allowed to express their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that endanger the state is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad often start to generalize because of negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-wing comrades meet who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, something like this is well fought and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so intertwined internationally and that&#39;s a good thing in my opinion that we couldn&#39;t afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I don&#39;t understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it wasn&#39;t sold out.
I already ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It&#39;s still about my order, which is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black be delivered to Germany or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I only ever find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the piece of wood are two deep indentations that have been filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Tidy by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been occupied with something for a long time.
I&#39;m very disciplined and organized at work (I&#39;m self-employed, very little free time), but throughout my life I&#39;ve had a hard time keeping my household clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything is left lying around, and now and then it grabs me and I tidy up and clean.
But it&#39;s never really &quot;that someone could come and visit spontaneously&quot;.
My husband is (unfortunately) no better either, it does bother me somewhere, but mostly housework simply loses out against work and disinclination.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you manage to become more tidy with a child?
We don&#39;t have one yet but we&#39;re working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn&#39;t bother me that much as long as there are no visitors and there are always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you remain sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically preformed cut offers maximum comfort and a perfect fit, allowing for almost unrestricted freedom of movement.

Careers in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in the field of software development and have now completed my apprenticeship for about a year.
Unfortunately, I&#39;m realizing more and more that this job isn&#39;t the right one for me, which is why I&#39;ve been thinking for a long time about starting over and studying social work.
The problem: I have an insecure (or anxious avoidant) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I have a hard time engaging in casual conversations and have been told on a number of occasions that I seem aloof (although I think that&#39;s gotten better).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don&#39;t want to work as a street worker or in an open youth club, but rather in addiction counseling or family support, for example.
However, I don&#39;t know if the specific day-to-day work is really what I imagine it to be, and it&#39;s difficult to find anything about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about in my code (&quot;still screwed up the simplest things&quot;) and I find it difficult for more experienced colleagues to ask for help (&quot;I should really know how to do it myself by now&quot;/&quot;I keep him from work with my stupid questions&quot;/&quot;he must think I&#39;m really poor&quot; etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every job, but I wanted to mention it at this point.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I&#39;m waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean by return please?
When I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
are there problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein consumed with the food is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and from these in turn builds its own body proteins, which it also needs for plumage formation.
The formation of plumage in nestlings and the formation of new plumage in molting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high level of stress on the animal&#39;s entire organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this can lead to disturbances in the incubation process.
Following this course of administration of NEKTON-Bio, you should go back to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is advisable to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A level measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe plumage damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the beginning of the new plumage formation is visible.
Then the normal dose is given until the feathering is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, away from direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to say my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in contradiction to the statute
Hallo r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So application made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I did not receive a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think so, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany

Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthrown.
Before I go into detail here.. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - that is, from you.
I&#39;m doing the ref right now as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked there in one area (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I won&#39;t name anything more precise here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up becoming a teacher and I was sure that was it - even if the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn&#39;t care.
I&#39;ve now reached the third &quot;I google other job postings&quot;.
And it&#39;s only been half a year.
The times before that I&#39;ve always decided to go ahead and at least finish the ref, after that I can always switch.
But right now I&#39;m absolutely done.
I&#39;ve had so little free time in the last month that I&#39;m completely drained.
It&#39;s vacation time now, but there&#39;s still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my end of work was my end of work.
I was free then.
And the stress at work didn&#39;t matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically it&#39;s fun and from the outside the ref is doing well too in terms of feedback and such.
But I&#39;m completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can handle before it shuts down completely - if it isn&#39;t already.
I&#39;m wondering whether I want it to be like that for the rest of my working life - especially when I&#39;m reading some of your posts here - or whether I shouldn&#39;t go back to the old area after all, where I was valued and take my free time I could when I needed it, and although I found the work kind of boring, I was paid appropriately for it and worked on something together in a team and not as a lone wolf, as is the case most of the time now.
But then I ask myself whether, in a year&#39;s time, I won&#39;t be back where I am now and not satisfied.
You notice that everything is somehow confused, but maybe you as an outsider have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation that I am completely exhausted and start crying at the slightest thought.
I&#39;m not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably won&#39;t lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see some light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that&#39;s enough for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertones on my part.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has continued to evolve, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the &quot;Valve Reactor&quot; circuit, which perfectly emulates the behavior of a tube amp.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art when it comes to sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers come up with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is based in part on real analog circuitry because it simply does a better job of capturing the tonal variations and nuances of a tube amp than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances just bubble up.
With VOX&#39;s &quot;Tone Room&quot; software, you can even correct and twist historical facts on a virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you always wanted them to.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 has again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amp: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amp in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and, based on this finding, developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Featuring a 12AX7 tube, the Valve Reactor circuitry in every VT+ amp perfectly replicates the behavior, subtle nuances and tonal character of a tube amp.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic&#39;s losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it&#39;s not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually positionable and foldable Velcro fasteners, it can be tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
Of course, what ultimately fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible configuration would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a clip-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models in the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (Olympus MFT cameras, Fujifilm XA or E series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic things.
Drone pilots also make the best choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the lava flows have caused great damage on the Canary Island.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days now, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past few days, but volcanologists have not dared to predict when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable,&quot; said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other structures, RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick layer of lava.
That corresponds to almost 1,700 football pitches.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new promontories with a total size of about 50 hectares were formed off the coast by cooled lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly badly affected. Half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly on it and it was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were badly affected, wrote the newspaper &quot;El País&quot;.
Christmas and the presents
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and crackling excitement, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving gifts, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-building &quot;social contract of primitive peoples&quot;, escapes the rigid routine and is re-established in the context of this tradition can be filled with life.
How Santa Claus became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the days of Christmas to giving presents.
Before that, gifts of one kind or another were given to each other on St. Nicholas Day.
The background to this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the window of three women in one night to spare them another life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving presents gave rise to the popular custom in Germany of filling children&#39;s boots with presents.
Protestants resented this custom because they rejected mediators between God and man as &quot;saint worship&quot;.
For these reasons they object to the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christ Child out of St. Nicholas and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so narrowly, only very few are annoyed that the custom of Saint Nicholas, like the Martin custom with Martinsingen and Martin parade, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources show a tradition of giving gifts since the 13th century on Saint Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving presents shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a happy muddle about the question of who is going to bring the children the presents.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Santa Claus, who has been assigned some peculiarities over time.
These include, for example, his bushy white beard, which has little in common with the rather severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh that is pulled by reindeer and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the three kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.
I&#39;ve been getting this error message for the past 3 weeks when trying to download a new book, but my account and contact details are up to date:
Please help with troubleshooting as I

Thanks so much.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace
A gunman was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man allegedly armed with a gun and entered a bank and bookmaker&#39;s shop.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by officials a little later.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
which one?
No matter where I click, I am immediately forwarded to your site.
The decorative lamp blends harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is easy to set up and can be anchored to the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Burn time max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow with color from within.
»Smart Stone«, on the other hand, is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design was deliberately chosen: during the day, this modern light object presents itself like a naturally formed, large pebble.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where it knows how to assert itself thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: as a solar light, »Smart Stone« requires neither a cable nor batteries.
Place the »light stone« anywhere that is exposed to the sun during the day.
Two supplied ground spikes ensure a firm hold if required.
The matte white plastic case itself is sturdy and weatherproof.
»Smart Stone« discreetly hides its solar panel inside, along with its battery and two LEDs – one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
When dusk falls, »Smart Stone« starts to light up automatically; You decide in which color: you have a choice of six attractive light colors – in addition to daylight white.
Finally, switching off takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a specified minimum or it gets light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
I&#39;ve done that several times and it doesn&#39;t work.
It&#39;s a shame, I would have liked to have continued to order from you, but if the voucher isn&#39;t credited to me, then I won&#39;t order again as a matter of principle.

pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I&#39;m doing everything right here, it&#39;s actually my first post after a year on reddit.
About my problem: About five years ago I had to start taking the pill again, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and damn PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave that alone because I have to take enough medication that I can&#39;t choose due to chronic illnesses.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain but my skin.
During my last break of about two years I had exploded in breakouts from 0 to 100 and they were everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn&#39;t feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without fuss, but maybe there&#39;s something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn&#39;t take me that seriously and a dermatologist&#39;s appointment is still to come.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had bad neurodermatitis before the break, then a period of rest, then large-scale lichen planus and the acne issue.
I also have nutrition in the course of chr. illness tried everything possible and got stuck on a mixed diet containing sugar, milk and meat, because nothing else worked really well.
It&#39;s also possible that the hormones are just wormy, but when you have construction sites everywhere like me, you don&#39;t want to go looking for anything else that&#39;s going wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina or similar.
Wrote and now I&#39;ve lost the conversation and I don&#39;t know what the response to my request was.
I always have to work in between and answer the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but is it generally available in large sizes
since it is available in large black

In the name of the people: Lay people make judgments
In the courtroom, they sit on the judge&#39;s bench in everyday clothes.
But a lot depends on their verdict, even if they don&#39;t wear a robe: lay judges work with professional judges to determine whether and for how long someone will go behind bars.
Two of them report in an interview with the &quot;public&quot; from their time at the Bad Kreuznach district court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the district court on John-F.-Kennedy-Strasse.
Hello, unfortunately I cannot access the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# again to the email address given above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no way of keeping them for that long.
We would use the table as offered by them as if it were ours
gladly, had already ordered the same chair in blue in nov
Does the cabinet have to be completely dismantled for pickup and refund?
and when would be the pickup?
110 kV underground cable will be newly built in 2022
The permit for laying the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision by the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The underground cable, which is around seven kilometers long, will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from January 3rd, 2021 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in part.
The blue order number:#PRS_ORG# with the consignment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the comment &quot;Delivery not possible&quot;.
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how to proceed now?
A nice start into the week!
You can forget that, I explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a glass dresser and the entire sides are split open so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because nobody is allowed into my apartment
Thank you for your message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it&#39;s with all books, that&#39;s why the request for #PRS_ORG#, since it&#39;s probably a general problem
Ref: Plan Lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I&#39;ve been at the Ref since the summer, I enjoy teaching, but I&#39;m currently having major problems planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technically, so that in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school I can also only copy b/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors and for me every hour actually stands for itself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand I don&#39;t want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I also need that for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I actually always start with the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn&#39;t have).
We have the book Terra and I&#39;m rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book in a time-efficient manner.
Would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
The trade fears for the Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
Most shops are only allowed to those who have been vaccinated or have recovered.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains about a drop in sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the point of view of the German Retail Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retailers.
HDE General Manager Stefan Genth criticized the drop in sales for transactions with items that are not used every day.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies viewed the remaining days of the year negatively.
Many have already written off the Christmas business.
&quot;What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless hole,&quot; said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only going well in food retail and online.
The association called for the consequences of the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
&quot;2G when shopping does not get us any further in the fight against the pandemic,&quot; he emphasized.
The current regulations discouraged customers and required a lot of staff.
The ribbon regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
According to this, every customer only has to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops on that day with the wristband they received.
In addition, random checks should suffice in retail - as is already the case in local public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of difficult Christmas business.
Most recently, without 2G, frequencies were a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, and sales were around 90 percent.
These numbers will certainly fall in the middle of the all-important Christmas business,&quot; said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the &quot;Wirtschaftswoche&quot;.
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, attempts are being made for the centers to find solutions and get them approved.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, in which &quot;the visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof once at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed&quot;. dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a flaw on the frame that was attempted to be covered with yellow filler.
That doesn&#39;t look nice.
I would like to return the mirror and have already put it back in the package and sealed it.
How do I proceed now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities takes care of setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two default color temperatures: daylight and tungsten.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas from a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness with virtually no change in color temperature.
It&#39;s a great tool for working both on the film set and in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller enables remote control of the light in TV studios or when the light is installed in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to carry out the settings for the individual settings on the memory locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons and you&#39;re done.
The memory controller saves the current status of the lamp when it is switched off, so that the known situation is restored when it is switched on again - very practical when working in the studio, for example. the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with batteries One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - a battery tester is also built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two displays (the left battery in the upper display, the right one in the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with power via the supplied power pack.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for attachment, so you can connect them directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted using brakes on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilting joint is included in the scope of delivery.
It is great that the scope of delivery also includes a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories that you may want to buy without any problems.
It&#39;s a shame, I got it as a gift and it&#39;s too small :(
&quot;Party we wanted to throw&quot;: Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had not won twice in a row, were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then the SGE turned up the heat, shot the frustration of a mixed season start from the soul within a good hour and won furiously 5:2. &quot;It&#39;s amazing what the boys did today,&quot; said coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and gave a &quot;general praise to everyone who was there&quot;.
At the beginning it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who are now in ninth place and still below their expectations.
Patrik Schick gave Leverkusen a 2-0 lead.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
&quot;How the players came back and put in a fantastic performance,&quot; Glasner continued.
I&#39;m incredibly happy with the performance that we showed and of course also with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday after recovering from a muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his team-mates.
&quot;I think our mentality is unbelievably great,&quot; said the 27-year-old and was particularly happy for the spectators with a look at the result.
That was the party we were going to throw today.
Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself for the upcoming tasks, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It&#39;s extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are in top physical condition.
It&#39;s top work in our medical department, but the players are also highly professional.
Now they want to &quot;go further step by step and remain modest&quot; and &quot;complete the tasks at this level&quot; until the turn of the year.
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6.30 p.m., Sky) on Wednesday as part of the English week.
I just got the mail that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and got it redirected, no chance.
Can it be reshipped directly to me or do I have to wait for the money to be returned and place the order again?
For me that would unfortunately mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a long time.
Have you ever sat in the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for women&#39;s handball before quarterfinals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany&#39;s handball women sneaked off the floor with their heads hanging and their eyes blank.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection suffered a bitter defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face hosts Spain in the quarterfinals.
&quot;We were far too scared and had too much respect for our opponents,&quot; said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to be different against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It&#39;s a shame we couldn&#39;t keep the flow with us.
That was a bad game from everyone that we have to delete,&quot; said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, the 2019 World Cup runners-up will have to improve significantly next Tuesday in order to keep the tender dream of their first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in a duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
&quot;We were just not there - neither in attack nor in defence,&quot; admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: &quot;We have to look forward quickly now&quot;.
Not up to par from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par with the kick-off.
Missed throws and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse things from happening with a few saves.
The DHB team scored the first goal after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial spark.
The German women could hardly stage themselves against the aggressive defense of the Danes - and if they did, they mostly failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game went early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke also saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into play a little better and approached at least five goals until the break.
The only slight hope of catching up after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-disposed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer pull themselves together to increase their performance and left the floor as the clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions during the Christmas season
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we got hold of St. Nicholas Day and are taking this as an opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions in the run-up to Christmas, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve and the Christmas holidays.
How was it at your house back then?
As with your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the best for the children?
The boot cleaning?
Bake cookies?
Decorate the tree?
Is there music?
Is Santa Claus coming, or is the present from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone makes an effort at and around Christmas to have as nice a family as possible.
Whether these are fixed traditions or even something different every year: tell us how it worked or works in your family!
please send me any transaction number.. or anything else that might help
transfer confirmation...etc
I would like to give you a voucher code
as with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
does that work for you?
The title says it all, I work as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated primarily in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be largely finished, I will then continue to work in vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects as well as medical questions, as long as they are not related to you personally (e.g. &quot;I&#39;m taking medication X, is it compatible with the vaccination..&quot;).
My area of responsibility includes providing information about the vaccination, the indication (a person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona Vaccination Ordinance and there are no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in the event of an allergic reaction (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, eg medical specialists.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any with us, but &quot;only&quot; (for God&#39;s sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, who cannot (are allowed to?) carry out vaccinations, so that I carry out most of the vaccinations there myself .
Difficult &quot;Huidlerer&quot; question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a &quot;Huidlerer&quot;?
This dialect word, sent in by someone from Amberg, caused a lot of thought on the BR television program &quot;Wir in Bayern&quot;.
But unlike many previous days, the term stayed in the &quot;Host mi?&quot; this time unguessed by the callers.
No, it wasn&#39;t a &quot;person who is nervous&quot;.
And no one &quot;for whom everything has to happen quickly&quot;.
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
Whereupon the man from Amberg shared the solution and thus caused astonishment among many people from the Upper Palatinate.
&quot;The Huidlerer&quot;, the spectators learned, &quot;is a rag that someone uses to wipe the stove&quot;.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word &quot;Houdern&quot;.
Which closed an educational gap - probably also for a number of people who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven&#39;t been able to buy any books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, restarted, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice for racing bikes - really that puncture-proof?
I woke up this morning full of energy because I wanted to train at least a little bit in preparation for my bike tour next week.
No sooner said than done and I set off on my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then something happened that lurks in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Shards of glass on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn&#39;t want to go along with the rest of the route.
Because it was a weekday, I had no real opportunity to get a spare jacket and spare inner tube, so I had to turn around in a halfway bad mood and take the first train home that came along.
My mood wasn&#39;t that bad, maybe it&#39;s better if I practice changing tires again before the bike tour.
But now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route ahead of me over several days, I would really hate to have this problem more often.
Now it really wasn&#39;t that bad, because the previous owner also had the old tires (very nice old man, ripped off 120 km on the day I came to pick up the bike by 2 p.m.!) and who had already described them as suboptimal because he rode with them for several years.
But when I think about the fact that I still have to change tires after 80-90kms driving, then I think I&#39;m in a really bad mood :D
Now I got into conversation with an older man on the platform, who asked me why I didn&#39;t have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be unplatable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really that indestructible?
I don&#39;t feel like spending 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed.
I also ask myself: I think I have 25x622 on my racing bike at the moment.
There are also (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend other tires for a road bike?
The swallow side seems my absolute! Lay people rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and best regards!
Car throws against tree: driver fatally injured

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would have new blood.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, a suitably designed stand is included in this building proposal to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a subordinate role, but for whom an exceptionally high level of sound is to be achieved.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to generate such high sound pressure levels with almost no filtering.
That doesn&#39;t mean the SOLO 15 sounds weak, however.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight rise in highs.
This is generally the case with full-range speakers in order to optimize the bundling, which increases sharply at high frequencies.
Aimed precisely at the listening position, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Turned slightly outwards, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound pattern can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The benchmark, extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure fine dynamics that are second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our kits, it is advisable to think about the final look of the loudspeaker at the beginning in order to plan for the corresponding changes during construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the housing, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer adds material again.
After all the panels have been cut to size (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base panel at the appropriate point so that the cable can be fed through there later without any problems.
With the help of a router, the loudspeaker opening follows in the front so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be inserted flush.
This opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer on the back in order to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screwing points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture &quot;Detail chamfer&quot;.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the bottom are now glued onto this.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in material thickness if required, for example if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
This is followed by all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides and the front.
Using a suitable circular hole saw or a Forstner bit makes it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the connection terminal on the rear panel.
Then you use a round cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
The base plate is then firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
Marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill bit) the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal follow.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuum / blow out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
Push the entire, uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and let it protrude by about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, the cable is routed to the speaker opening and also allowed to hang out loosely there.
The crossover is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the crossover and the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions for the Solo 15 crossover.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed on, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, is sealed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, you can drip hot glue onto the opening and close it.
The sealing can be checked through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed tight with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut in two and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; Finally we can announce that we are organizing the OSCAST again this year!
&gt; For known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per button, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
&gt; We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it&#39;s still a pandemic - but we will do everything we can to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
&gt; It will start at around 0:30.
Get your drinks cold, plan some good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
