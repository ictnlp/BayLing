From my point of view, the literature program was formed by the ladies of the Balzac age based on their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those same ladies of Balzac&#39;s age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were plush to represent a certain variety?
There are roses of this color and with such a structure of the petal, reminiscent of velvet, as a rule, dark red, burgundy tones.
And light roses look different, the petals have just a satin or silky sheen.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Model &quot;Micropackage Prestige&quot;: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different hardness of the sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by latex coconut fiber and natural latex, the moderately soft surface is formed by a natural latex slab.
The spring unit with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the sleeper&#39;s body, preventing the appearance of the &quot;wave&quot; or &quot;hammock&quot; effect.
Among the advantages of the model, it is necessary to highlight breathable materials.
The latex, perforated for breathability, ventilates naturally, just like coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the bed is maintained.
The mattress also comes with an extended warranty.
The term of the official warranty from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact, the life of the mattress is longer.
Protection against dust and dirt is entrusted to a removable jacquard cover supplied in the kit.
Get an orthopedic pillow in pair with the mattress - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.
Turn on your brain and drive such relatives away!
It&#39;s better to have none than these...
Either look for a third-party driver, or someone who is willing to invest and work with you at a fraction.
If it does not work out, then sell the car, albeit at a loss, do not regret it.
Think better next time...
Andrei, you were clearly explained that pensioners work in schools, they will not work on the command line.
The teacher of computer science will not be able to help either, he was not taught this, the shkolota plays games in Windows.
So no support.
With horror I remember these feasts and guests in the house of my parents.
The guests are on the doorstep, and the cutlets are still being fried on the stove, the disheveled mother is cleaning the floor.
Lord, yes, I sat down at the table already exhausted.
And then wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday you drag food, two days of cooking, a day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They are good, and a cake is always with you.
Since then, I do not like holidays, guests.
Even for my family I set the table at the minimum.
And I cook delicious treats for them, I bake very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth Coronavirus Shot Imminent
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, no two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough for complete protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
On Saturday, December 11, according to Die Welt.
&quot;We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the fall,&quot; the expert said.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be carried out &quot;in combination with the flu vaccine.&quot;
This will help you get the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination may help in the fight against the spread of a new strain of coronavirus &quot;Omicron&quot;.
Moreover, the new version is especially dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with &quot;Omicron&quot; is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the Omicron coronavirus.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that at two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: &quot;the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.&quot;
&quot;This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against challenge with the omicron strain,&quot; BioNTech and Pfizer said.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favor of shortening the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
&quot;The experience of Israel shows this very convincingly,&quot; the expert emphasized.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally created with ice fishing in mind, and not just cast fishing.
These vibes have a larger specific gravity than their counterparts close in size, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and resilient plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a &quot;winter vibe&quot;, the Bet-A-Vib shows quite an aggressive game in plumb fishing.
Often the most catchy is a simple monotonous animation, that is, moving the rod up and down with almost no pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space littered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles for which a hook is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when catching zander and large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when pinpoint and aggressive bait feeding is required.
Having reached the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.
The Bet-A-Vib is equally successful in winter fishing for pond trout.
To cater to her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It has also been noted that Bet-A-Vib is able to irritate a passive pike, which does not even react to live bait, by playing in a plumb line.
When cast, the Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, goes well with fishing line and braided cords of even large diameters.
For throwing pike, pike perch, ruff or perch, in addition to uniform, the &quot;step&quot; is also relevant, sometimes with &quot;striking&quot; along the bottom.
If you are fishing in tight places, you can change the front tee to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of hooks.
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
With the same success it can be used both in relatively shallow and in fairly deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young idlers sit on the neck of old parents.
&quot;Golden youth&quot; - obviously lazy people for the most part, who do not know how and do not know.
A well-fed life is conducive to idleness.
Perhaps Mishustin meant this large part of the population.
You are right, you are joking.

Libya announces 7,000 Russian mercenaries
There are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) &quot;Wagner&quot; in Libya.
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri.
&quot;Currently, there are more than 7,000 Wagner PMC mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at the Gardabiya airbase (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte),&quot; Anadolu quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are &quot;trying to capture&quot; the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after &quot;bringing their man to power&quot; in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the interlocutor of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and &quot;located in Libya.&quot;
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an air base and port in Sirte, as well as an air base in Jufra, the agency notes.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where else can there be mercenaries
According to the agency, &quot;Wagner&quot; presumably operates in nine African countries - Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner&#39;s subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use minerals and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technology and military services to these countries.
According to the media, the &quot;Wagnerites&quot; allegedly fought in the Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed either in the law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not in the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
Recall that earlier the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
The Council of the European Union is expected to approve this decision on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with the dominant Islamists in it, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for the election of deputies of parliament and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
&quot;There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing,&quot; the material says.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country&#39;s foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
“Examples of success are “they defended in Syria, restored peace there”, “the decision on Nord Stream-2”, “the whole world was intimidated that it was a cool weapon”, “We squeezed Crimea”.
The main failures are &quot;conflict with Ukraine&quot;, &quot;confrontation with Western countries&quot;, &quot;isolation from the world,&quot; according to a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paper-based office work - all public services have also become only digital
The Government of Dubai announced the complete rejection of paper-based office work and the transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the UAE news agency WAM.
&quot;Today marked the beginning of a new phase of digitalization in all aspects of Dubai life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government,&quot; Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of the emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, said on Saturday.
From now on, internal and external document flow in all state institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government&#39;s initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of workflow began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, as the authorities calculated, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary terms.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, about the dates of birth and how old the child is, this is already insanity, about the class and group in the kindergarten too.
Well, I do not believe that such bunglers exist.
And if they do, they obviously don&#39;t care about anything, including the family.
My mother lived, her two brothers and grandfather and grandmother on 3 Vladimirskaya, there was a 1st floor without bars.
First they knocked on the door, then on the window, then they decided not to stand on ceremony, they broke the window and climbed in, but the grandfather had a baseball bat, which they received.
These people knew for sure that there was someone at home...
Turkish car production and exports fall below 2020 levels
Turkey&#39;s car production and exports fell sharply in November as the lira depreciated.
As a result, the industry&#39;s performance for 11 months turned out to be worse than last year&#39;s result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were produced in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were sent for export, which is more than 25% less than last year&#39;s figure.
And if, according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, the Turkish automotive sector showed positive dynamics compared to last year, then according to the results of 11 months of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year&#39;s figure.
The reason for this fall was the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira, which fell 29% against the dollar in November.
This led to a drop in economic activity in all industries.
More than 500 SMEs received deferred loan payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation with the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, Kazinform correspondent reports.
&quot;According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the regulation and development of the financial market, this year, in pursuance of the order of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 No. business,&quot; Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to a deputy&#39;s request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferred payments on loans provided for the provision by banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities of deferred payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including individual entrepreneurs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The grace period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the SME subject.
The borrower&#39;s application could have specified a different term for deferred payments.
During the grace period, claims and claims work, notification of the need to pay off overdue debts, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended in relation to the borrower,&quot; the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
In 2021, second-tier banks received applications to defer payments on loans from 603 SME borrowers, of which 553 SMEs received a deferment in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
131 SMEs submitted applications for deferment to MFIs, of which 95 entities were granted deferment in the amount of 105.8 million tenge,&quot; A. Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily tolerate the Okmiron strain
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system can tolerate it more easily than those with a strong protective reaction of the body.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the Okmiron strain of coronavirus could be dangerous.
The reason is to be sought in the conditions of the origin of the virus.
Scientists believe that &quot;okmiron&quot; originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunocompromised person.
That is, when mutating, he did not meet any resistance from immunity.
This makes him more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from the immune system, it became very fast.
Apparently, he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than expected, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system can tolerate &quot;okmiron&quot; more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-old young people die, and 60-year-old old people endure it in the form of a sneeze.
The immune response is frantic in the young, it is completely inadequate: where it was only possible to wag a finger, it hits sparrows like a cannon, Sergey Puryasev concluded.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs can be bacterial or viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to stop only the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, and malaise.
Then come respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain may also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, by the end of the year, the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old may begin to be vaccinated.
Virologist, head of the MIPT genomic engineering laboratory Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively affected by covid.
Adolescents who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active layer, as well as kindergarten students, - Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the MIPT genome engineering laboratory, told Moscow 24.
Many thanks to the author for this article.
Happy to bring back memories...

In those distant seventies and eighties, not a single dance floor could do without the melodies of this group.
And at home, gathering with friends, they arranged dances to their music.
Immunologists hypothesize why obese people become victims of covid
The authors of the work studied the adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from covid and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid the response of the immune system.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of this.
The biologist told about the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin named the causes of dementia and talked about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person finds it difficult to navigate even in a familiar environment.
Golosheikin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins most often lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of such factors as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible,&quot; he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by addictions - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disturbances and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
&quot;There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer&#39;s disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence,&quot; the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the required level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Formerly Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education of the Russian National Research Medical University.
N.I. Pirogova, Head of the Department of Cognitive Impairments of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnologies Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30 thousand artifacts illegally exported from the country
Over the past 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to return to their homeland about 30 thousand artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on the air of the Al-Hayat TV channel by the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington,&quot; he said.
Abdel Gauad specified that all artifacts smuggled out were registered in the archives.
Now the department&#39;s staff is working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts &quot;monitor auctions around the world and sales on the Internet&quot; through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon his return, the cultural property is restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities turned to Interpol with a request to help find a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
The auction house Christie&#39;s held an auction on July 4, at which the over 3,000-year-old bust was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally taken from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of antiquities illegally exported from the country at various times.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research by &quot;black diggers&quot;.
&quot;The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account&quot; - and rightly so, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in the Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees&#39; personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the US, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to a remote work mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank&#39;s management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the information about the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin&#39;s life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the poet&#39;s earthly existence and his &quot;ego&quot;.
He is already out of any literary associations, spat with Imagism, he is in himself, but known, in demand, at times strongly scolded by critics, even angrily, but the reading public is ready to carry him in his arms.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle &quot;Persian Motifs&quot; was completed, the poem &quot;Anna Snegina&quot; was written, 8 books were published, the collection &quot;Soviet Rus&#39;&quot;.
And the main success - at the end of June 25, the State Publishing House concluded an agreement with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the contemporary poets of Sergei Alexandrovich received such an honor, he was the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles a month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles a month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy Sofya Tolstaya, it was necessary to equip the family life, support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems that life was getting better, there is something to rejoice, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark colors, as if a nightmare materialized from the poem &quot;The Black Man&quot; (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin&#39;s death):
My friend, my friend
I am very, very sick.
I don&#39;t know where this pain came from.
Is the wind whistling
Over an empty and deserted field,
Or, like a grove in September,
Showers brains with alcohol.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had lost a lot, looked bad, and was clearly ill.
Increasingly repeated spree, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not only alcoholism ...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was made to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there were no reliable documents left.
Let&#39;s say, relating to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, improved his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Pyotr Gannushkin (Yesenin would come to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But there is plenty of evidence of the poet&#39;s binges, scandals on this basis, drives to the police - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
From the beginning of the 1920s, the poet&#39;s terrible romance with the green serpent developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly settled with a friend, imagist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he was found in rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.
Startsev recalls:
“He only came to spend the night, and in most cases in a deranged, drunken state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Yesenin fell on the landing ...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
Having come to his senses a little, he incessantly began to cough, splashing the whole sheet with blood ... &quot;
Yes, and Yesenin himself, after a trip to Europe and the USA (there was prohibition in the States then, but Duncan took a decent supply of alcohol with her) admitted:
“I didn’t see anything there, except for taverns and streets ...
At the end, I stopped remembering people ...
Well, I drank, of course...
And I drank because longing gnawed.

Now my son is almost 16, and he has not been tormented by the desire to fool around for a long time.
All energy is directed to the choice of what he will earn his living.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who periodically had problems with the law until the very wedding.
A father takes care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, &quot;with a strange love.&quot;
Why did the girl burst into tears at the exam, when she had not failed it yet?
Why didn&#39;t he tell his daughter that this is not a school.
Well, she has a tail.
So what?
Retake.
Millions of students know this.

Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus is using migrants as a &quot;weapon&quot; against the EU
Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a &quot;weapon&quot;
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Yablonsky expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a &quot;weapon&quot; against the European Union and intends to return to such an &quot;operation&quot; next year.
The Deputy Foreign Minister made the corresponding statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily &quot;stopped Lukashenka,&quot; but he &quot;is actively looking for new ways.&quot;
The Polish official is also confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons &quot;in many parts of the world.&quot;
As the site kp.ru wrote, earlier the European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they announced their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, &quot;if the situation in the country does not improve.&quot;
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

&quot;Not for Senka&#39;s hat&quot;: when a velvet jacket makes a laughing stock of a man
Velvet jackets dominated social events in 2021.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of No Time To Die, he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional Bond bow tie.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket that was inconsistent with the royal dress code to The Earthshot Prize eco-award ceremony, and then chose a more classic version for an event in support of the Royal Variety Charitable Foundation.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messiah also tried on the trend.
The footballer came to collect the seventh Ballon d&#39;Or wearing a Dolce &amp; Gabbana velvet jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for velvet men&#39;s jackets in Russia.
According to the service&#39;s analysts, received by Gazeta.Ru, they began to be bought 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, navy blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&amp;M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are presented this season in almost all brands - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most coveted model is considered to be Gucci, in which brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the film &quot;The House of Gucci&quot;.
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special technology of weaving threads, a dense fabric with a fleecy outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, they serve less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but relevance.
“Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a formal event,” Vakhoshkin explains. “It will also work if the invitation says the dress code is &quot;Black Tie&quot; or &quot;Creative Black Tie.&quot;
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
“A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, must acquire the right advanced party with prosperity,” the authors of the Telegram channel about men’s fashion “Handsome Brammell” believe. “The owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets .
They are simply invited to timed social events, where a dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from &quot;Handsome Brummell&quot; are sure that the appearance of an ordinary employee in a velvet jacket at a corporate party would also be inappropriate, but if we are talking about &quot;a leader from among those who run this event, then -&quot; yes &quot;, such a thing suits him&quot; .
If the employee is a lower rank, and his goal is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely evaluate this with the phrase &quot;not according to Senka&#39;s hat,&quot; the editors of the Telegram channel about men&#39;s fashion believe.
Very ambiguous sensations from the voice.
This is an unnatural timbre, it pulls so laboredly.
And it is not at all associated with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I do not understand the admiration of others.
But with all my heart I wish you good luck in life!
It&#39;s all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, paid.
Billion investment.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is also not at a loss - and gas, and oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are now selling.
Fuel is in high demand.
The penny drips.
And who then in flight?
As usual - an ordinary buyer.
Does the problem of the Indians touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who &quot;overslept&quot; the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good reward.
I did not see a single beautiful person in the pictures in the article.
Just mediocrity in terms of average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they will not get hooked on such people, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such &quot;beautiful (s)&quot;, but definitely not because of their appearance.

The immunologist said that revaccination after 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of coronavirus &quot;omicron&quot;
Revaccination four to five months later may protect against the new Omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination six months later, given the emergence of a new strain, &quot;a very long period&quot;
“With previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases - after four,” the expert said, calling for revaccination in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person received two vaccinations and a booster, or he got sick and got vaccinated, or got vaccinated and got sick, then he got ‘hybrid immunity’, that is, there are a lot of antibodies and neutralizing enough,” the expert said.
G7 warns Russia of &#39;massive consequences&#39; if Ukraine invades
The G7 countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of Foreign Ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia&#39;s &quot;military aggression&quot; against Ukraine &quot;will have enormous consequences and cost dearly&quot; to Moscow, but the document does not describe specific measures.
&quot;We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia&#39;s military buildup and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine,&quot; the statement said.
The ministers go on to call on Russia to &quot;de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and honor its international commitments to military transparency,&quot; as US President Biden spoke during a December 7 video call to Russian President Putin.
&quot;We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine,&quot; the G7 foreign ministers also said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in return,&quot; they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome the restrained position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,&quot; the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, said Russia would face &quot;serious consequences&quot; if it invaded Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed &quot;the united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of world GDP, and which made it very clear that an invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia.&quot;
Pfizer vaccine found 32 times less effective against omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This conclusion was made by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug for COVID-19.
“We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety,” said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against a severe course of the disease when infected with a coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of a coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry accused Germany of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kyiv
Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov has accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev&#39;s acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine&#39;s purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
It is noted that Berlin later softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kyiv intends to seek the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons in the framework of bilateral agreements with the allies.
In particular, we are talking about the US, UK, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on allowing arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect arms supplies from Berlin under Chancellor Scholze.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite the &quot;occupation by Russia&quot; of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is sure that Germany will retain the same &quot;illogical&quot; position under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kyiv was expecting help from Berlin to equip its navy.
Ukraine expects that Germany &quot;will be Ukraine&#39;s partner in a technical sense,&quot; the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the &quot;green&quot; party of Germany, Robert Habek, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kyiv.

Disclosed ways to return money stolen through online stores
There are several ways to recover money stolen from online stores and avoid becoming a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of large losses when bank card details fall into the hands of intruders, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be saved to a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend getting a separate card for online purchases.
If money has been stolen while shopping at stores that do not use 3D Secure security technology, you can initiate a refund process.
&quot;Within the framework of the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the settlement chain who does not use this service,&quot; a representative of Promsvyazbank specified.
Artur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, emphasized that the buyer has the right to file an application with the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Civic Chamber, director of the Safe Internet League, Yekaterina Mizulina, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 applications were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
Establishing a one-stop-shop for complaints about online scammers could be an effective solution under the current circumstances, she said.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with Russia&#39;s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years to come, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland&#39;s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
Poland&#39;s judiciary, however, remains one of the reasons for controversy.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine and its highest court ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not made a public commitment to stop the work of Nord Stream 2 in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
US officials have told members of Congress they have reached an understanding with Germany to shut down the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior US congressional official said Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm the reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine&#39;s border, a position confirmed by the G7 on Sunday.
Dimitri, take a closer look.
The view outside the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room was removed, so the second window is partially visible.
In general, those who are not familiar with the initial layout doubt.
And I know such apartments very well and I see perfectly how it was replanned.
May all be well with them.
It always surprises when they write about the means to wash the sink, toilet bowl, window sills, taps.
You wash them once a year at Easter, or something, which you have to wash straight.
Just don&#39;t let it get dirty.

The draft decree prescribes to reflect in the Foundation&#39;s charter that it &quot;is being created in order to promote literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers.&quot;
&quot;By &quot;creating conditions for creative activity&quot; is meant the creation of writers&#39; residences on the basis of transferred property in different regions of Russia, in which there would be comfortable conditions for creativity,&quot; the Ministry of Digital Development explained to our publication.

Doctors warn about the dangers of long-term use of blood-thinning drugs after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergey Tokarev warned about the danger of uncontrolled use of blood-thinning drugs after contracting the COVID-19 coronavirus infection and before being vaccinated against the coronavirus.
Therapist, immunologist Irina Yartseva said that self-prevention of the possible formation of blood clots after COVID-19 can provoke a stroke.
Yartseva explained that blood-thinning drugs are not for everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, was in the hospital, he had complications.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood-thinning drugs that prevent excessive blood clots) according to indications.
She said that obscurantism is now happening - everyone is drinking anticoagulants for a long time and getting complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (brain hemorrhage) against this background.
Chief prophylactologist of the Ural Federal District, scientific director of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in an interview with URA.RU, said that Russians now often use anticoagulants indiscriminately before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the Internet and begin to self-medicate.
There are such citizens who, a week before vaccination, by their own decision, begin to take anticoagulants.
And during a preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice bruising.
He emphasized that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without finding out the cause of any symptom.

Plumber who found money in church wall will be paid $20,000
A plumber who found money in a church wall in the US state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This was reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place at Lakewood, a large evangelical church where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that devout Christians will find wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was repairing one of the church&#39;s restrooms and found thousands of bags of money and checks under the insulation.
He gave the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive gratitude from Austin.
&quot;I wanted to hear him say, &#39;You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you have done and what you could have done, &quot;&quot; KPRC-TV quotes him.
Apparently, the find is related to the theft that took place in Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks, which were kept in a church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of 25 thousand dollars was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount as the award had already expired.
Despite this, Crime Stoppers of Houston, a non-profit organization that donated $5,000 for the award and later received another $20,000 as a gift from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber&#39;s honesty.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characterization &quot;as a real person.&quot;
Therefore, the attitude towards her is so negative.
And it&#39;s not that &quot;she is financially much richer than all the hacks,&quot; as they say here.
There are richer people, but not all of them behave so impudently, so defiantly, as this madam.

China reports new case of human infection with avian influenza virus
A new case of human infection with the highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus has been reported in China.
This was reported by radio station RTHK, citing a notification from the Hong Kong health authorities, TASS reports.
The infection infected a 68-year-old resident of the Huizhou urban district in the southern province of Guangdong, who kept poultry on the farm.
His condition is assessed by doctors as critical.
The world&#39;s first human infection with a strain of the H5N6 virus was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
Brazil requires citizens to show vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, they were obliged to require covid-passports from those entering the territory of the state, the corresponding decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Roberto Barroso.
It is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempted from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Also on the list of exceptions are people who arrived from countries where the absence of a vaccine has been proven.
&quot;The situation is even more serious when you consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year&#39;s Eve, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist traffic,&quot; Barroso said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities ordered tourists who were not vaccinated against coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
Total protection scheme against COVID-19 revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altshtein, in an interview with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme for complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and using a nasal vaccine.
With intranasal application, immunoglobulins A are formed in large quantities. This does not happen when the vaccine is administered by injection.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we produce the most immunoglobulin G (antibodies).
And if you give both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision on double vaccination yet,&quot; the doctor said.
The chief prophylactologist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help in that in this case, the protection of the body, presumably, should be maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseinov, said that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children would lead to a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is exactly the picture that is observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked with a male (he died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, feeding, affection, love and games for a bitch in heat, then go ahead.
But the dog was trained and generally smart.
He chose my society and went home.
In the video, a method that works in 90% of cases.
Not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I slowed down many owners so that they would not run after the dog, although they lamented that 200 thousand were running away (Pomsky), I took it straight by the hand and led me away in the other direction.
As a result, &quot;200 thousand&quot; chose the owner, and not the dog that ran somewhere out there.
Anti-vaccination protests continue across Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against covid mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some were holding signs saying &quot;This is a fake pandemic&quot;, &quot;I will not be vaccinated&quot;.
A major protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the Autonomous Community, a covid certificate is required to access bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightlife venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was taken by the authorities of a number of regions of the country against the backdrop of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then turned into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of demonstrators began to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolay S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as &quot;the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine&quot;, probably because she began to study earlier.
Let&#39;s just not argue, I think they both deserve this title.
I agree with Zakharova with only one thing: the Americans brought only death and plunder to any country, wherever they appeared.

WHO has discovered &quot;omicron&quot; in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that a new strain of coronavirus &quot;omicron&quot; has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could be disastrous.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported in a WHO report.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it began to actively spread only from the end of November.
WHO also expresses concern about the high rate of spread of a new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may bypass the Delta strain, aka the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all absolutely countries without exception, in terms of spread.
Prior to this, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the UK.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that Omicron will replace Delta in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that several hundred people are officially sick in the Kingdom at the moment, and according to estimates, up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the Omicron strain, and at its peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
What the British health care system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the Omicron strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian Sputnik V reacts to Omicron - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just started testing the Russian vaccine on the Omicron strain.

Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to maintain the warmth of relations between the older generation.

Unfortunately, we see each other more and more often at funerals.

Russians warned about a new scheme of scammers
Attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
Izvestia writes about this with reference to experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, director of products at Ivideon, deepfakes are the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools.
In this case, the scammers create a fake video based on real recordings of the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network manages to accurately reproduce the behavioral characteristics of a person.
Abutalimov added that using a deepfake, attackers can call the victim’s acquaintances via video link or create a video with a copy of a person to send out with the aim of blackmail.
&quot;Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, since a savvy attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scripts,&quot; the expert said.
Leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to video technologies.
David, I&#39;ll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow much makeup and walking in short skirts, showing stockings and tights with legs.
This is a province, but there WAS such a product in the store.
In big cities, Muslim women put on makeup and showed their thighs.
So it is in Dushanbe, it is a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but there is no the same cosmetics.
Here are five things you can do to help prevent diabetes
Blood sugar problems are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to plain water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sugary foods raise blood sugar levels to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by malnutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts recommend sticking to a low-carbohydrate diet.
Such a diet will not only help reduce weight, but also protect against sudden fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to a feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and increased absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about the “weekend migraine” among workaholics
Several factors can lead to a worsening of well-being on the weekend.
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working days is often “weekend migraine,” said a well-known endocrinologist, Ph.D.
According to her, workaholics especially often suffer from this, who have a headache, weakness and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated over the week, there are quite a few objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changing conditions.
Weekends change our lives.
“We sleep for a long time, we lie on the couch all day, most likely we eat more and drink less,” the doctor argued. “Due to the lack of coffee, a slight withdrawal begins.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and weakness.
An additional role is played by a late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, then there will be a reaction called jet lag.
It occurs in travelers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended to trace what changes the most on weekends.

South African scientists say Pfizer&#39;s Omicron vaccine is ineffective
In South Africa, they announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against &quot;omicron&quot;
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
It (the level of neutralization of &quot;omicron&quot;) is estimated to correspond to a (level of) 22.5% effectiveness of the vaccine against a symptomatic infection, because of which ... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is called into question, the text of the study, published on portal MedRxiv.

Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in common foods?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that under an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product, hidden sugar may be indicated - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calorie content, composition and glycemic index.
The label may contain several dozen names, in fact, denoting sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars such as dextrose (corn-derived sugar), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, doctor&#39;s sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce your sugar intake is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, and pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the name of the ingredient in the composition of the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, by 2045 Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate neutral country.
&quot;That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role,&quot; the Chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany remains committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is currently essential for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin supported the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock said that the process of certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, within the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline still &quot;does not comply with the requirements&quot; of the European Union.

Hackers hacked Indian Prime Minister&#39;s Twitter
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as legal tender, and also that the country had already purchased cryptocurrency.

Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter reacted quickly - access to the account was restored.
The page of the Prime Minister of India was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
Majority voted against independence in New Caledonia referendum
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12 at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted against the independence of their territory during the referendum.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third voting was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) of those who voted were in favor of New Caledonia&#39;s independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90%, in total, more than 80 thousand residents of New Caledonia took part in the elections.
As France-Presse commented on these interim results, &quot;the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt,&quot; as independence supporters urged voters not to vote.
Being the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full and &quot;honest&quot; election campaign.
This non-participation thus paved the way for a third victory for the supporters of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
The separatists said they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is due to speak on the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia&#39;s independence did much to revive the final weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have spoken out in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is &quot;the last region of the European Union&#39;s presence in the Pacific.&quot;
&quot;New Caledonia must necessarily remain French,&quot; Eric Zemmour repeatedly repeated.
Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse, who published an op-ed in Le Figaro at the end of October urging Caledonians to remain French, made the same statement.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position &quot;because it is not his responsibility.&quot;
However, the president added: &quot;France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia.&quot;
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed &quot;strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France.&quot;
Light, oh hello!
I&#39;ve been a little ... a little rude to you, it&#39;s still embarrassing, ashamed.
Thanks for sticking with my channel.
On the subject: I am not an artist, I love to draw, but it turns out to be an inspired daub.

Turkey tests world&#39;s first laser-powered drone
Turkey has successfully tested the world&#39;s first drone with a laser weapon.
UAV &quot;Eren&quot; was tested at a distance of 100 to 500 m, according to &quot;MIR24&quot;.
The device is capable of neutralizing explosive objects at a distance using a laser.
The maximum flight altitude of the novelty reaches 3 thousand meters.
After passing the relevant tests, the UAV should enter service with the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy explosive devices without the involvement of sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

WSJ Readers Criticize Article on Russia-U.S. Relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the article expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and made a number of offensive remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on the Western countries to &quot;show a united front against Russia.&quot;
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
&quot;There is quite a lot of false information in this article,&quot; RIA Novosti quotes a comment from one of the readers.
&quot;Europe is not ours to be &#39;losed&#39;, and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and NATO allies will never enter into a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine,&quot; another said.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The source lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing jet drones of a new generation
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was announced on December 11 by Aleksey Arestovich, a freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian president.
That is, they are able to act against air targets, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of Turkish avionics: a hull and the like,&quot; Dialog.ua quoted him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it &quot;in all characteristics.&quot;
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the course of military operations of the joint forces in Donbass.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky announced that construction of a plant for the production of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kyiv region, which will train personnel, as well as test and maintain Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum &quot;a big real step forward.&quot;
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions have escaped at Singapore&#39;s Changi airport.
It is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions, which arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were going.
One of the runaway lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from him because of the protective net installed nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of employees of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which is in charge of all Singapore&#39;s zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from the owner and walked around the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warn of the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research suggests that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, in particular colorectal.
However, exceeding the required dose, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor Beth Kitchin of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, nutritionist, advises keeping track of the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if there is a significant deviation from this figure, up or down.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 tablets without a doctor&#39;s recommendation, be sure to monitor your dosage, and avoid cereals with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Because it is found in avocados, among other things, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat the fruit more often.
In the UK, by April, about 75 thousand people could die due to the omicron strain
Forecasts by British scientists show that up to 75,000 people could die in England in the next five months due to the spread of the omicron strain of coronavirus, if restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific advisory group for emergencies under the British Cabinet, by April 2022, at least 25 thousand deaths due to the omicron strain will be recorded in the country, and about 175 thousand people will be hospitalized. patients.
At the same time, at the peak of the incidence, hospitals will receive more than 2 thousand infected people daily.
“Strong measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent the National Health Service from being overwhelmed if the omicron strain is found to be more contagious than the delta variant, and current vaccines cannot eliminate infections,” said LSHTM mathematician Roseanne Barnard.
Earlier, the UK Health Security Agency informed that if the rate of spread of the omicron strain remains at its current level, then by the end of the year, about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country.
At the same time, by mid-December, the Omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, 1898 cases of infection with the omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 were detected in the last day.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10 thousand cases.

Demand for superyachts grew by a quarter in the world
Superyacht builds this year and bookings for next year are breaking global records, despite calls to cut their carbon footprint and fight climate change.
In the world ship registry, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of fighting the effects of climate change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it&#39;s hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a $50 million or more floating fortress will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more vessels were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there has not been such a rush in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear contagion on land and prefer to escape the pandemic aboard their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are carried out by zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
&quot;People just want freedom, and the super-rich could afford it,&quot; he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of hardship, traveling into space, living on yachts or flying in their own planes cause social irritation because the elite do not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are urging governments to take action and are proposing new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, even though they know that with such money mobility, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of ordered super-yachts is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 have a stern length over 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke builds the 183m REV Ocean yacht.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht is provided with a &quot;lunar pool&quot;, as well as a submarine designed to explore the depths of the sea.
Helicopter pads, open-air cinemas have become common on existing superyachts, and martial arts platforms have become commonplace on some of them, like wrestler McGregor&#39;s yacht. total greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is negligible.
But it has a symbolic meaning, given that there are just over 2,000 multibillionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the footprint of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the world&#39;s biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trail landed on his 162.5-meter long Eclipse yacht.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to drive the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don&#39;t get the sympathy of others when, like Australia&#39;s richest woman, Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, they complain via YouTube that there is no place for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol, leading to the development of bowel cancer, has been determined
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
Writes about it edition of the Daily Express.
Experts concluded that drinking four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, men who drink moderately have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a process that is harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they do not realize how developed four-legged pets are actually.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments in order to find out for sure how intelligence is developed in animals.
Although a dog&#39;s vocabulary is not as extensive as a human&#39;s, a new study shows that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, they do not understand anything about politics, economics and art, meanwhile they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts say, show the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but there are still not enough statistical data for accurate conclusions.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists came to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of learning ability are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine, prepared for the bargaining of the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will &quot;bargain&quot; over Ukraine&#39;s entry into NATO, analyst Oleksandr Kochetkov said in his article for Glavred.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations in the near future on guarantees from the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries &quot;to join anywhere.&quot;
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send the offerer.
And in relation to Ukraine, bargaining is planned,&quot; the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks a dialogue with Kiev.
&quot;Preparation is carried out covertly, quickly and they immediately proceed to offensive actions, and do not wait until the group is discovered and deployed by counter-forces,&quot; he said.
China stimulates the development of the railway transport industry
China&#39;s advanced technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Exhibition held in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province / Central China /.
Core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd., allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical problems, said company spokesman Hou Zhaowen.
The high-speed trains on the China-Laos railway line, which went into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will improve the reliability and availability of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of rail vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing &quot;Chinese speed.&quot;
In May this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd rolled off the first Chinese-designed high-speed electric trains for export to Europe.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train developed by the above-named company for Turkey began.
The train will move along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city&#39;s airport.
This metro line will be opened to traffic next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
&quot;China&#39;s railway equipment industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness,&quot; said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the trade and investment department of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade (CCIMT).
&quot;This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-end equipment manufacturing in the global market,&quot; said Feng Yaoxiang.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced railway equipment manufacturing system, with a complete set of auxiliary facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxiang, the country ranks first in terms of railway electrification and operating mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin, in an interview with radio Sputnik, listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of mild cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, plan, and reduce the level of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer&#39;s disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheikin emphasized that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and lack of certain vitamins can be the causes of dementia.
He added that Alzheimer&#39;s disease and cerebral atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking.
&quot;There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and expediency are still being discussed in the scientific community,&quot; Golosheikin said.
&quot;The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking,&quot; Golosheikin said.
The dementia research charity in the UK said earlier that the disease is increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer&#39;s disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered problems with vision, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts called aphasia - a condition when a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili needs neuropsychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the council of doctors created under the Georgian Ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili&#39;s] neurological status is leading in his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character,&quot; the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
&quot;We call this neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia,&quot; Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which is not in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after he was disciplined by prison officials.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to cancel the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.
Alexandra, &quot;Do you also take money for this?&quot; I wonder where these people come from...
is it normal to pay for bread in a bakery, but not for the work of a tutor?
Or are we so holy that we feed on prana?
There is another side of the coin here.
These people are parasites on the body of society.
They do not work, do not pay taxes, live on benefits and at the expense of their relatives.
At the same time, they receive full medical care.
How many mouths can a worker feed?
We feed all drunks, drug addicts, who also lost their health because of their stupidity.
Then we are surprised at the extension of the retirement age.
These amounts could be spent on the treatment of really sick people.
Of course, the red flag of Victory will forever remain in the history of our country and should not be confused with the state flag.
The red flag has a reverse side, is a symbol of the communist movement, so it will never again be able to be state.
It&#39;s time for the author to tie up with provocative articles, it&#39;s time for the Reds to calm down and start living a normal life, and not the past.
Spain protests against COVID-19 passports
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests were held against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, reports Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory to go to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightlife venues.
Many demonstrators came to the action without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
The protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship, and called vaccination an experiment.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected in Spain, more than 88 thousand patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
The government submitted bills on a unified system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit venues for mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a past disease, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will apply to travel by train and plane.

Steep climb: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create world-class resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million people to winter sports, which will raise the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but will also contribute to the economic development of backward outlying provinces.
The Taiwu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to infrastructure construction, landscaping work is also carried out in the region: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, this is still a long way off.
Games advisor Justin Downes says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every year more and more Chinese go to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many more years to establish a ski culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and the infrastructure necessary for recreation needs to be created there.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chungli, close to the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chongli, and now not a single one of the locals suffers without work.
More and more shops selling clothes and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
Catering outlets with dishes of national cuisine are opened on the slopes.

More than 500 million people around the world could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, says WHO
More than 500 million people around the world could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled humanity&#39;s progress towards universal health care, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) have said.
On the occasion of December 12, International Universal Health Coverage Day, WHO and the World Bank have published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic led to disruptions in the provision of medical services, caused excessive stress in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population with immunization has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and World Bank stressed that the pandemic caused &quot;the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment.&quot;
This situation pushes more than 500 million people &quot;into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket.&quot;
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic had pushed more than 100 million people into poverty, with more than four billion people having little to no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister cut off from &#39;Democracy Summit&#39; broadcast at White House request
Taiwan&#39;s Digital Minister Audrey Tan&#39;s panel discussion at the US-sponsored &quot;Summit for Democracy&quot; has been switched to no video mode, YouTube footage of the summit shows.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was the map, on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map that Ms. Tang was showing was compiled by the South African NGO CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted in green as &quot;free&quot;, while China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were highlighted in red as &quot;closed&quot;.
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced with a screenshot with the note that the opinions of the panelists &quot;do not necessarily represent the position of the US government.&quot;
China was not invited to the Democracy Summit.
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister could run counter to the &quot;one China&quot; policy pursued by Washington.
One agency source said that after the map was shown, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-sponsored &quot;Summit for Democracy&quot; was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the &quot;zero day&quot; of the summit, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an &quot;anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge.&quot;

China steps up COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control in cities with land crossings
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People&#39;s Republic of China issued a circular ordering to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land crossings are located in order to further prevent the importation of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving these cities must provide a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result obtained within 48 hours prior to departure.
Travelers to cities with land crossings must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day when the respective provincial-level administrative divisions determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities that have land crossings and that meet certain conditions may consider creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Foreign Ministry spoke about the &quot;sad conclusion&quot; in relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergei Ryabkov, in an interview with Izvestia, assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long way of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not start yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long journey that we have come with the current administration, and with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday,&quot; the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is connected with the desire of the United States to impose approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington&#39;s position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there is no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and Americans will heed the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns of the dangers of vaccinating with a nasal preparation against COVID outside hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal vaccine against COVID-19 may develop allergies and need medical attention, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping centers.
This was announced to TASS by a virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize nasal vaccination points at airports and shopping centers, but at first I would do it only in medical institutions.
The fact is that there is a probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that the person then sit next to the doctor&#39;s office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work in just a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary,&quot; Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience is gained in using the drug.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person vaccinated with nasal congestion blows his nose after injection.

Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of &quot;aggressive actions&quot; against Ukraine, including because of the alleged &quot;invasion&quot; of the country&#39;s territory.
&quot;It is impossible to introduce any restrictions against Russia and not experience suffering yourself,&quot; the official representative of the Kremlin said on the air of the Rossiya 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that &quot;everyone in the world understands this.&quot;
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to impose restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank German Gref is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonians reject idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to secede from France.
This was announced on December 12 by the French TV channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of those who voted were against independence.
Supported independence from France 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
The level of participation in voting that day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, the region already held a referendum on independence.
Most of the inhabitants supported the fact that the archipelago was part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France claimed New Caledonia as its own.
About 270 thousand people live in the archipelago, the territory is endowed with a special administrative-territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

WHO tentatively considers &quot;omicron&quot; less dangerous than &quot;delta&quot;
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively believes that &quot;omicron&quot; is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in case of a disease with a new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, Omicron is registered in 63 countries.
&quot;Preliminary data and a significantly altered protein antigenic profile of the Omicron strain suggest reduced vaccine efficacy against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is assumed that it (“severity of the disease” - ed.) may be less severe than with “delta,” the WHO technical report says.
The organization notes that so far all reported cases of omicron infection in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
However, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than the &quot;delta&quot;.
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They &quot;were previously immunized,&quot; the Gamaleya Center said.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, said that so far there is no reliable evidence that the new version of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the rest.

Four scenarios for Zelensky named in Ukraine
Former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may be left without the support of the West, and also, perhaps, he will make compromises on the Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko said in a publication on the Glavred portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called the &quot;perfect storm&quot;, assumes that key Western countries will no longer support Ukraine, having reached an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
This development will contribute to a deep crisis that Kyiv may face in 2023.
&quot;At the same time, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export &lt;...&gt; internal protests and confrontation between the authorities and key FIGs (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.),&quot; the ex-MP added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - &quot;a war against everyone.&quot;
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine may make compromises on Donbass, as a result of which confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of summer, Zelensky&#39;s position will weaken, the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former people&#39;s deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between groups of the population and the president who disagree with Zelensky, which is why it is likely to seize control of the power bloc and implement &quot;populist initiatives.&quot;
During this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin &quot;reformatting power,&quot; Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the &quot;father of the nation.&quot;
This can lead to some event that will be a strong shock to society.
&quot;The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine,&quot; Denisenko said.
This version of the development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made disaster or Russia&#39;s aggressive actions, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has more than once rejected any possibility of an &quot;attack&quot; on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from a poll by the Rating sociological group showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record lows, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for the ex-president of the country Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3% of respondents expressed support for the president.

Thanks to the author for the story about the great athlete, I didn’t know that Elena Shushunova died, it’s very upsetting to find out.
I remember how I rooted for her at the Seoul Olympics, for us, the inhabitants of Primorsky Krai, it was a live broadcast, real time.
Such intensity of passions, emotions went off scale, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They also rejoiced at other victories, as they rooted for Salnikov, for the football players, for all the then Soviet athletes.
I once saw a documentary on TV about one of the Central American countries, and there watermelons were rolled up the ladder on board the ship like barrels.
The watermelons were enormous.
I myself worked many times in my youth harvesting and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and did not meet watermelons weighing more than a pood.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from melons and not earlier than the beginning of August.
Balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, article: 12008).
Bra-balconette with soft lace cups, on the frames.
The lower part of the cup is reinforced with an inelastic transparent fabric.
The lateral inner part of the cup, in the area of sewing on the straps, is reinforced with an inelastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that allows the lace not to stretch.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the scalloped neckline and under the bust.
Vertical boning on the single layer microfiber side panels keeps the fabric from curling at large sizes.
I didn’t like the article very much, angry, poisonous.

A poet arrested for a protest on Red Square: &quot;They give 10 days for a quote from Yevtushenko, here it is, the power of poetry!&quot;
At the beginning of the week, the 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A HSE student was detained on Red Square with a poster with the hashtag #a poet in Russia is more than a poet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander under an administrative article on repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
The first time he was detained on January 23 at Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
&quot;The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of the common culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag,&quot; Alexander explains.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and reveal the message of his message in more detail.
How did the police treat you during your arrest this time and before?
What did they ask in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time, the employees were more correct, the detention was maximum, polite, no matter how ridiculous it may sound in some context of the word.
On Pushkinskaya, the riot police took and took it hard.
Asked standardly, about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
With the exception of the monkey house blown on all 4 sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was doing.
And if, after the action, under this hashtag, at least a few people begin to write their own poems, I will not spend these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, in private, speak at least the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of those around them, so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks excellent Russian and nevertheless resorts to the help of an interpreter.
And even at official events, a transcript is kept in the old fashioned way with a fountain pen, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.
If you don&#39;t want a lot of words, say no!

Researchers reveal how potatoes help fight age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and minerals that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root contains B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body&#39;s systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to the high content of fiber, it is good for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use, it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root crop is best stewed or boiled rather than fried in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, like other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are carbohydrate foods that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sugary soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper Kommersant warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in private farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the issuance of &quot;Yandex&quot;
Relegation Candidates
In 2015, the rights holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the Runet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, director general of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series &quot;The Squid Game&quot; and &quot;Tenderness&quot; directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of ivi, the largest video service in Russia (part of AIV ).
On Kinogo, which is also available in the search engine results, you can watch the animated novelty &quot;Encanto&quot;, but judging by the quality of the video, this is the so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot at the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series &quot;Univer. 10 Years Later&quot; by the TNT channel (part of Gazprom-Media) is available.

Mattress Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient in that it has two surfaces that are different in terms of softness - high rigidity and slightly more than average.
The composition of the product includes only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model there is a block of independent springs &quot;micropackage&quot;.
This means that there are 2000 spirals per bed, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point adjustment.
&quot;Micropackage&quot; is the highest frequency of the entire variety of spring blocks &quot;Dimaks&quot;, therefore it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: combinations of coir and natural latex layers are installed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, then the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long been a classic, since it transfers to the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the coir provides the correct support for the back, then the latex gives the adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Pouch: Model comes with a quilted Aloe Vera knitted pouch.
At the request of the client, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load per bed is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: warranty period - 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress is CertiPUR certified.
Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, Actual Camera reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions starting in five years is to assess the habitability of the clouds of Venus, and then search for life there.
For the project, scientists from Tartu have proposed instruments for measuring the acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but Venus was probably originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, then the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth or different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then perhaps it will be more likely that life originated on Earth,” said Mihkel Pajusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The topic of the metaverses became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as well as all over the world, will invest in the creation of their own metauniverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend to create remote interactions in a pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models for them.
On the third, they are a logical continuation of the asset digitalization trend, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to a digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing the diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too fatty and harmful.
Of course, we will have a traditional Olivier and a herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one forces me to eat up everything at once.
You can eat a spoonful, try - and that&#39;s enough.
After all, there really are ten days off ahead, you can cook any tasty and healthy dishes.

And the one who didn&#39;t go in for just sports or can&#39;t imagine all the circles of hell that she went through, DON&#39;T JUMP WITH JUDGEMENT.
The British economist was unable to give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O&#39;Neill was unable to provide a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts will turn into a failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The coronavirus pandemic remains the most important factor, followed by inflation, he said.
O&#39;Neill also admitted that he does not know if the increase in commodity prices is temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of endless generosity of central banks has already outlived itself” and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates adjusted for inflation will correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O&#39;Neill noted that, against the background of the pandemic, the continuation of the ultra-soft economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as increasing poverty and climate change, O&#39;Neill concluded.
Earlier, the head of the global research department at Otkrytie Investments, Mikhail Shulgin, said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin called the Fed&#39;s monetary policy, oil price dynamics and fears amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Forced to agree.
But one thing pleases: if you compare yourself with yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country&#39;s GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI) agency.
To understand the scale, approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country&#39;s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenue in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is the leader.
For 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
Kia&#39;s sister brand Hyundai has even more significant growth - more than 35%, and revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is also in the lead in terms of the increase in the weighted average price of a car - over the year for Hyundai it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger dynamics of price increase.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands did not grow so significantly: according to the statistics of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - by almost 12%.
Japanese Toyota closes the top three in terms of sales in terms of money - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand increased both sales volume (by 37%) and the weighted average price of a car (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles). ).
&quot;Mercedes-Benz is simultaneously seeing good growth in sales and the weighted average price - more, for example, than BMW - hence the greater growth in financial capacity,&quot; explained Tatyana Arabadzhi, General Director of NAPI.
In terms of sales growth rates, Chinese brands are showing fantastic results, which also significantly increased their financial capacity this year.&quot;
The Russian Lada in terms of income growth dynamics demonstrates average market indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity, there are companies whose car sales in pieces fell in 2021: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is completely in the red - for 10 months, the Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of auto components and interruptions in production that have engulfed the entire global auto industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same AvtoVAZ increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last rise in price (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end november.
Regularly rewrite the price tags for their products and other automakers.
The volume of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation also contributes to this, as well as the desire of automakers to win back past losses, experts say.
In the context of a shortage of cars, I think that many automakers were even able to partially pass on to the consumer the costs of past periods that they could not include in the price of cars earlier,
says Vladimir Bespalov, an auto industry analyst at VTB Capital. -
I think automakers are doing very well financially, maintaining high sales margins.&quot;
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars that are observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert specifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
As supply increases, the scope for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to earn their income from volumes, says Sergey Burgazliev, an independent automotive industry consultant.
Given increased demand and insufficient supply, automakers are now looking to make the most profit from every car sold, Burgazliev said. -
An increase in the production of cars is not expected for at least the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the backdrop of the current market situation, cars turned out to be a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its original cost, the expert states.
Biden spoke about the transfer of the US military to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending US troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian &quot;invasion&quot;.
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
&quot;There have never been such plans,&quot; the head of the White House said, answering a journalist&#39;s question about whether the United States abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to the Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
&quot;We will have to send more US and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia,&quot; Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, and also in the fact that &quot;American weapons are approaching our territory.&quot;
I leave these interviews right now.
If already at the interview they want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an incomprehensible drink and wash another cup - it&#39;s scary to imagine what will happen at work.
I will find a normal place for myself, without an HR layer, where you immediately talk to the manager.

If a scammer calls from a similar number, such as an &quot;employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs&quot; or another law enforcement agency, then it is inefficient to immediately drop it, and most likely it will not be possible to blacklist it in time.
Because in order to confirm his lie about involvement in law enforcement agencies, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to frighten and persuade.
We need more useful advice for the people.
This is such nonsense...
I don&#39;t quite believe that this was the case.
They no longer know what to think, who to blame.
We got to the Queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame, except for the very best ...
And it would not be easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if our people care about their people.
Maybe all strains of the virus will disappear ...

The film of the student of Alexander Sokurov received the European &quot;Oscar&quot; for the best editing
The Oscar-nominated Russian film Unclenching Fists won the European Film Academy (also known as the European Oscar) award for Best Editing, according to Moskovsky Komsomolets.
The jury of the competition, which voted online due to the difficult epidemiological situation, appreciated the outstanding skill of the filmmakers.
The maximum number of awards was received this time by the film by Jasmila Zbanich (Bosnia) &quot;Where are you going, Aida?&quot;
The main character of the tape is a translator at the UN mission, who is trying to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama &quot;Unclenching Fists&quot;, filmed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov&#39;s workshop), this film tells about the difficult relationship between an imperious father and those who want to free themselves from paternal guardianship of growing children in North Ossetia.
