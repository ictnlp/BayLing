From my point of view, the literature program was formed by Balzac-aged ladies based on their interests.
From 19th century Russian literature, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the perspective of those same women of Balzacian age.
But psychology and the sufferings of heroines in Tolstoy and Turgenev's works are not as interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are generally rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were plush to depict a certain variety of them?
There are roses of such color and with such a petal structure resembling velvet, usually of dark red and burgundy tones.
And light roses look different, their petals have a satin or silky shine.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige mattress 105x195.
Model "Micropacket Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different levels of firmness on each side: the medium-firm surface is made of latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, while the moderately soft side is made of a natural latex slab.
A spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, it is necessary to highlight the breathable materials.
Perforated latex for breathability ventilates naturally, just like coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate is maintained in the sleeping area.
The extended warranty period also applies to the mattress.
The official manufacturer's warranty period is 5 years, but in reality, the lifespan of the mattress is longer.
Protection against dust and dirt is provided by a removable jacquard cover that comes with the set.
Purchase an orthopedic pillow to go with your mattress - it is recommended for maintaining the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.
Use your brain and drive those relatives head to head!

Andrey, it was explained to you clearly that pensioners work in schools and they will not work on the command line.
The computer science teacher won't be able to help either, they weren't taught this, the kids are playing games on Windows.
So there is no support.
I shudder at the thought of those feasts and guests in my parents' house.
The guests are at the doorstep, while the cutlets are still being fried on the stove, and the flustered mother is washing the floor.
Lord, I was so exhausted that I could barely sit at the table.
And then wash the dishes again, clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you drag groceries, cook for two days, and clean up the day after.
And what about the guests?
They are doing well, and they also have a cake with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays or guests.
Even for my own family, I set the table with the bare minimum.
And I cook them delicious treats, I bake very often just for fun.
Germany: Fourth vaccination against coronavirus is inevitable.
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will likely be enough for complete protection.
This is the conviction of the head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt.
Die Welt reported this on Saturday, December 11th.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with vaccination against the flu".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new Omicron strain of coronavirus.
Moreover, the new version is particularly dangerous.
So, the likelihood of reinfection with "Omicron" is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omicron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
The study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "neutralizing potential decreases by more than 25 times."
"BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized that this indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the Omicron strain."
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates for a reduction in the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, according to Zaltsberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel convincingly demonstrates this," emphasized the expert.
Pontoon21 lure, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the company Pontoon21®.
She (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created with the intention of being used for ice fishing, not just for casting.
These lures have a higher specific gravity than their similarly sized counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the top fin made of durable and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal retrieves.
As a "winter vibe" when fishing in a vertical position, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy animation is a simple monotonous one, that is, the movement of a pendulum up and down with almost no pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space cluttered with underwater vegetation, roots, and other obstacles that can be caught on.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when catching winter zander and large perch, especially in the middle of winter when precise and aggressive bait delivery is required.
Having reached the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to its original vertical position.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter fishing for pond trout.
To cater to her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise-cancelling capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that playing Bet-A-Vib in a vertical drop can irritate a passive pike that does not even react to live bait.
When fishing with a cast Bet-A-Vib demonstrates distance and accuracy.
This lure is easy to understand and not picky, it pairs well with both monofilament and braided lines, even of larger diameters.
For catching pike, zander, perch or pikeperch, besides the uniform retrieve, the "step", sometimes with "tapping" on the bottom, is also effective.
If you are fishing in overgrown areas, you can replace the front treble hook with a double hook, which will reduce the likelihood of snags.
Among lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most durable and, as a result, one of the most effective.
It can be used with equal success on relatively small and quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, it was announced that there are 7,000 Russian mercenaries.
There are over 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) "Wagner" in Libya.
This was announced on Sunday, December 12th, by the Chairman of the High State Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri.
Currently, there are over 7,000 Wagner PMC mercenaries in Libya.
They also have airplanes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
"They have 30 jet planes at the Gardabia airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," Anadolu agency quotes him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also stated that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after they "bring their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence.
According to a source of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya".
"Wagner" has been present in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, according to the publication by the agency.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC is receiving support from the Kremlin.
Where else could mercenaries be?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is believed to operate in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection of energy facilities.
"In exchange for these services, the subsidiary companies of Wagner receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies, and military services to these countries," the article says.
As claimed by the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the Central African Republic.
This group is not registered in any law enforcement agencies or in the registry of legal entities, and its fighters are not listed in the personnel rosters.
This company is under US sanctions.
Recall that earlier, the ambassadors of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the decision will be approved by the Council of the European Union on December 13th.
The situation in Libya.
The highest state council of Libya de facto serves as the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions dominated by Islamists, according to TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the unified voting day for the elections of parliament deputies and the head of state from December 24th to at least February 2022.
"The elections are less than two weeks away, and the chances of them being held on time are rapidly decreasing," the article notes.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has indefinitely postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates, according to Sky News Arabia.
"Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians."
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, while 29% believe that failures prevail.
Examples of successes - "we protected and restored peace in Syria", "decision on Nord Stream 2", "we intimidated the whole world with our cool weapons", "we took back Crimea".
The main failures - "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world" - are stated in the research of the "Public Opinion" Foundation.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paper-based document management - all government services have also become digital-only.
The Dubai government has announced a complete abandonment of paper-based document production and a transition to digital technologies.
All government services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marked the beginning of a new stage of digitization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of the Emirate and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, on Saturday.
Now, internal and external document flow in all government institutions in Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all industries without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitization of document flow began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, as calculated by the authorities, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, about birth dates and how old the child is, this is already madness, and about the class and group in kindergarten too.
Well, I don't believe that there are such clumsy people.
And if they do exist, they clearly don't care about anything, including their family.
My mother, her two brothers, and grandparents lived at 3 Vladimirskaya on the first floor without bars.
They knocked first on the door, then on the window, then decided not to be polite, broke the window and climbed in, but grandpa had a baseball bat with which they were hit.
These people knew for sure that someone was at home...
The production and export of cars in Turkey have fallen below the level of 2020.
Production and export of cars in Turkey sharply decreased in November against the backdrop of the devaluation of the lira.
As a result, according to Bloomberg citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey, the industry indicators for the first 11 months were worse than last year's results.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were produced in Turkey from factories in November, which is 20% less than the previous year.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
And if the automotive sector of Turkey demonstrated positive dynamics compared to last year during the first 10 months of this year, then by the end of November 2021, car production was already 0.3% worse than last year's figure.
The reason for such a decline was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira exchange rate, which fell by 29% against the dollar in November.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 small and medium-sized businesses have received a deferment on their loan payments in 2021.
The First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, according to the correspondent of the Kazinform news agency.
According to the information from the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, in fulfillment of the President's assignment from April 1, 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 "On Approval of the Procedure for Providing Payment Deferrals for Loans to Small and Medium-Sized Businesses," wrote Alihan Smailov in his response to a parliamentary inquiry.
He reminded that the procedure for granting loan payment deferrals provided for banks and microfinance organizations to grant payment deferrals for loans issued to SMEs, including individual entrepreneurs, before April 1, 2021, during the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The grace period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the MSB subject.
The borrower's application may have indicated a different payment deferral period.
"During the deferment period for the borrower, the creditor suspended the claim and lawsuit work, notification of the need to repay overdue debt, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments," noted the deputy prime minister.
In 2021, second-tier banks received applications for loan payment deferrals from 603 MSME borrowers, of which 553 MSMEs were granted deferrals totaling 9.7 billion tenge.
"A total of 131 MSB entities applied for a deferment in the MFO, of which 95 entities were granted a deferment for a total amount of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are capable of easily tolerating the "Omicron" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may tolerate it more easily than those with a strong immune response.
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the "Omicron" strain of coronavirus could be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the conditions of the virus's origin.
Scientists believe that "okmirron" originated in the body of a person infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
That is, during the mutation, it did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
Thanks to this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the lack of response from the immune system, he became very fast.
"Apparently, he may have more of these spike proteins, spikes, than is necessary, and his antibodies were not reduced during mutations," comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may tolerate "okmiran" easier than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is often the case with pneumococcal infections, where young people in their 30s die, while elderly people in their 60s can simply sneeze and get over it.
"The immune response is insane in the young, it is completely inadequate: where it was only possible to threaten with a finger, it hits like a cannon at sparrows," said Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first one is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, often only the symptoms can be alleviated - all hope is on the organism.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of body intoxication - this includes fever, weakness, and malaise.
Then come respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, a tickle in the throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left side, as well as abdominal pain, can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, they may start vaccinating the younger generation aged 12 to 18 by the end of the year.
Virologist and head of the genomic engineering laboratory at MIPT, Pavel Volchkov, noted that this category is very actively affected by COVID-19.
Among teenagers who attend school, the number of contacts is maximum.
"This is the most socially active layer, like kindergarten graduates," said Pavel Volchkov, virologist and head of the genomic engineering laboratory at MIPT, to "Moscow 24".
Huge thanks to the author for this article.

Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why obese people become victims of COVID-19.
The authors of the study examined adipose tissue remaining from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected and showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also studied the adipose tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and flu viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir in an attempt to evade the immune system.
Likely, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this as well.
The biologist talked about the causes of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Golosheykin named the causes of dementia and talked about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself with a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty even orienting themselves in familiar surroundings.
Golosheykin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins are the most common causes of dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing a disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol levels, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
"He said that at the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity can play a role."
Dementia development is also influenced by harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders, and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in abstract thinking.
"A discussion is underway that hearing loss may be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development," added the biologist.
To prevent the onset of disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, the professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Medical Genetics at the Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education RNIMU named after.
Anna Bogolepova, head of the cognitive disorders department at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology, talked about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned around 30,000 artifacts illegally exported from the country.
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return about 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country back to their homeland.
On Saturday, December 11, the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad, reported this on the Al-Hayat TV channel.
Since 2011, the Egyptian government has managed to recover 29,300 artifacts.
"Only this year, 5300 artifacts of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered in the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gauad clarified that all artifacts smuggled out have been registered in the archives.
Now the employees of the department are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "track auctions around the world and sales on the internet" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that cultural values are restored upon return and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities turned to Interpol with a request to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, which was sold at an auction in London.
On July 4th, the auction house Christie's held an auction where a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (approximately 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally exported from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amun, has been kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
It is unknown how the relic ended up in Europe.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of ancient monuments illegally taken out of the country at different times.
According to authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (according to the census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation consists of two words!
The only thing that unites them is the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants to gain access to employees' personal mobile devices.
Credit Suisse is requiring its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, according to Financial Times.
The thing is that in Europe and the USA, Swiss banks do not provide their employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner telecommunications operator.
According to current rules, the bank may view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to address business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank reserves the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote work mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse is not commenting on the information about the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was productive in terms of creativity, but the heaviest for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego".
He is already outside of any literary associations, he has parted ways with imagism, he is on his own, but he is known, in demand, sometimes strongly criticized by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are true masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, and the collection "Soviet Russia" was released.
And the main success - at the end of June of the 25th year, Gosizdat concluded a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the modern poets have been honored with such a distinction as Sergei Alexandrovich, he is the first!
Moreover, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, the factory director received 300 rubles per month, and the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed like never before that year.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter, Sophia Tolstoy, and had to arrange a family life, support his sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems like life was getting better, there was something to be happy about, but for him everything is predominantly painted in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) has materialized.
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Either the wind is whistling.
Above an empty and deserted field,
As if a grove in September,
Alcohol is frying my brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had weakened significantly, looked bad, and was clearly ill.
There are more and more cases of wandering and nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not only alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis as alcoholism was given to Sergey Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
Let's say, referring to May 1923, when Esenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan, was improving his health at a clinic near Paris under the care of Professor Petr Gannushkin (Esenin would return to him two years later, this time in Moscow).
And here are the poet's accounts of drinking binges, scandals on this basis, and plenty of trips to the police station - scattered throughout dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 1920s, the poet's terrifying romance with a green snake was rapidly developing.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin briefly stayed with his friend, the imagist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, despite his very decent income, Esenin never had his own home either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, and he lived in rented apartments, hotels, or with acquaintances.
The old man remembers:
He only came to spend the night, and in most cases in an insane, drunken state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the staircase landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
Having come to his senses a little, he began to cough continuously, splattering the entire sheet with blood...
And even Esenin himself, after his travels through Europe and the USA (where there was Prohibition at the time, but Duncan brought a decent supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
I didn't see anything there except for taverns and streets...
I'm already towards the end and I stopped remembering people...
"Well, and of course he drank..."
"And I drank because boredom was gnawing at me."

Mattress Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195.
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern interpretation of a budget model in the premium class range.
The foundation of the mattress is a block of independent double springs called Duet.
Inside the large spring, a smaller, softer spring is inserted.
This allows for an even distribution of weight on the mattress.
The mattress is supplemented with a filler - artificial latex - on both sides.
This is an analogue of natural latex, but it is denser and less expensive.
The flexibility and elasticity of this material increase the comfortable effect of the mattress.
Artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it does not absorb moisture and dust.
The mattress will be perfect for a couple with a significant weight difference (of 30 kilograms or more).
Thanks to the "smart" springs, there is no wave effect here when a light partner rolls to the side of a heavy one.
A pleasant, soft to the touch cover made of practical jacquard Sense is sewn with a layer of synthetic winterizer.
Natural fabric does not accumulate static electricity.
It is possible to manufacture this mattress model in a compressed version (vacuum roll-up packaging).
Now my son is almost 16, and he hasn't had the desire to act crazy for a long time.
All his energy is directed towards choosing what he will do to earn a living.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who had occasional problems with the law until the wedding.
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "with a strange love."
Why did the girl start crying during the exam when she hadn't even failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it's not a school?
Well, she will have a tail.
So what?
Retake.
Millions of students know this.
What is the conversation about anyway?
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU.
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon".
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pavel Jablonski, expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The Deputy Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the corresponding statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko," but he is "actively searching for new ways."
The Polish official is also convinced that illegal migrants will now be used as a weapon "in many parts of the world".
As reported by kp.ru, the European Union has previously implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He contacted 17 individuals and 11 organizations physically.
Europe has announced its readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve."
In response, Minsk introduced a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not according to Senka's hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughingstock.
Velvet jackets dominated at social events in 2021.
Perhaps the first person to announce their new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die," he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional "Bond-style" bow tie.
After his example, Prince William followed twice, who first wore a green velvet jacket that did not correspond to the royal dress code for the Earthshot Prize award ceremony, and then chose a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was tried on by Lionel Messi as well.
The footballer came to collect his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress is already noting a growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, whose data was received by "Gazeta.Ru", they began to be purchased 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue, and of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose velvet suit sets less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next, and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are presented in almost all brands this season - both Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most coveted model is considered to be Gucci, in which brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci".
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special technology of interweaving threads, a dense fabric with a fuzzy outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but they also serve less accordingly.
Fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin from Lamoda warns that when it comes to a velvet jacket, the most important thing is not its model or style, but its appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, that's why such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a formal event," explains Vakhoshkin. "It will also be suitable for those cases when the invitation specifies a dress code of 'Black Tie' or 'Creative Black Tie'."
Another important criterion that allows choosing a velvet jacket is the status of its buyer.
According to the authors of the Telegram channel "Handsome Brummell" about men's fashion, a man in a velvet jacket should first of all acquire the right advanced social circle with wealth. Owners of velvet jackets usually belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to themed social events where a dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with similarly formal items such as classic trousers with pleats, solid-colored shirts, silk ties, tassel loafers, and cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Beau Brummell" are sure that it would be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if we are talking about "a leader among those who run this event", then "yes", such a thing would be appropriate for him.
If an employee has a lower rank and their goal is to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to earn financial bonuses, it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion believe that the management will appreciate it with the phrase "not according to Senka's hat".
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
This is an unnatural tone, it is so strained and drawn out.
And it is completely unrelated to the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well-lobbied, meaning it's paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy is also not at a disadvantage - both gas, oil, and coal were purchased cheaper than they are currently being sold.
There is a high demand for fuel.
A penny is dropping.
And who is then out of luck?
As usual - an ordinary customer.
Do the problems of the Native Americans concern the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who have "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a decent salary.
I didn't see any beautiful people in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity within average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it off to the whole train car, then most likely no one will sit next to them.
But only due to mental disorders and ignorance of such "beauties", but definitely not because of their appearance.
"Kazbek, a slave who is aware of his slave status and fights against it, is a revolutionary."
A slave who is unaware of their slavery and languishes in a silent, unconscious, and speechless life of servitude is simply a slave.
"A slave whose saliva flows when he smugly describes the delights of slave life and admires a kind and good master is a serf, a boor."
The immunologist stated that revaccination after 4-5 months will help protect against the "Omicron" strain of the coronavirus.
Revaccination in four to five months can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "Omicron".
Immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov made such a statement, calling vaccination after six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, a "very long period".
"Under previous strains, such a timeframe was normal, but now it is best to undergo the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic illnesses - after four," said the expert, calling for revaccination to be carried out in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has received two vaccinations and a booster, or has recovered from the illness and been vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and then recovered, then they have acquired "hybrid immunity", meaning they have many antibodies and enough neutralizing antibodies," clarified the expert.
"The Big Seven" warned Russia about the "large-scale consequences" in case of invasion into Ukraine.
The countries of the "Big Seven" (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France, and Japan) have released a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be costly" for Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement says.
Next, the ministers call on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels, and comply with its international obligations regarding transparency in military activities," which President Biden spoke about during his video call with Russian President Putin on December 7th.
"We also confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with the aim of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," said the foreign ministers of the G7.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
"They warn that Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price to pay in response."
We confirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
"We will intensify our cooperation for our common and comprehensive response," the statement also says.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, stated that Russia would face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her words, this meeting showed "a united voice of the countries of the G7, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia."
The Pfizer vaccine was considered 32 times less effective against the Omicron strain.
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 drug.
"We see that the majority of people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, however, this ability was significantly reduced against the Omicron variant," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe illness when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the influence of the Omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the Omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense accused Germany of blocking NATO weapons supplies to Kyiv.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12th, Reznikov reminded that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles for shooting down drones.
At the same time, it is noted that Berlin later softened its position regarding rifles, recognizing them as immortal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kyiv intends to seek the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the USA, Great Britain, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the permission of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect weapons deliveries from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained their refusal to provide weapons as a risk of military escalation in the conflict in Donbass, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is confident that Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position even with a new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Kyiv expects assistance from Berlin in equipping the navy.
"In Ukraine, they count on Germany to be a partner of Ukraine in technical terms," added the president.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated for the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

I combined the living room with the kitchen.

It was.

"Mercedes" has filed a protest against the results of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
The German team "Mercedes", whose driver Lewis Hamilton finished second behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, has lodged a protest against the final race result, according to the Formula 1 press service.
Mercedes believes that during the race, rules 48.12 and 48.8 of Formula-1 were violated.
In the first case, the German team challenges the judges' decision to return the circular racers to one lap with the leaders.
According to the second - Verstappen overtook Hamilton before the allowed "restart" zone.
It should be added that now the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, according to which Verstappen outpaced Hamilton by 2.256 seconds and won the Formula 1 World Championship, is preliminary, and it is not known when Mercedes' protests will be considered.
G7 warned Russia about responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine.
Foreign ministers of the G7 countries have warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression towards Ukraine, according to the joint statement.
Meeting participants also noted that they condemn the strengthening of Russian armed forces at the country's borders.
"There should be no doubt in Russia that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," says the statement published on the website of the UK government.
The ministers of the G7 countries and the High Representative of the EU noted that they are "united in their condemnation of Russian military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine".
The head of the UK Foreign Office, Elizabeth Truss, warned of "serious consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine during a press conference in Liverpool.
"We made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences..."
"She said, 'The G7 wants Russia to abandon aggression towards Ukraine'" (quote from TASS).
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis caused by the buildup of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
The discussion was about negotiations in the "Normandy format".
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke out in favor of a dialogue on Ukraine in the "Normandy format".
Russian Foreign Ministry representative Maria Zakharova stated that by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "admitted their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes."

Ways of returning money stolen through online stores have been revealed.
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by experts in information security during a conversation with RBC.
Thus, to reduce the risk of major losses when bank card data falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on a card or bank account that is not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be deposited into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen during purchases in stores that do not use the protective technology 3D Secure, it is possible to initiate a refund procedure.
"According to the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without using 3D Secure, responsibility is placed on the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, emphasized that a buyer has the right to file a claim with the bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money can be returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been shipped for delivery.
On November 19, member of the Public Chamber and director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 complaints had been received regarding various cases of fraud, ranging from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her words, an effective solution in the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online scammers.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation.
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for negotiations related to the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream 2".
Although Scholz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed clear expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that he will urge Scholz to oppose "Nord Stream 2", which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it will help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
However, the judicial system of Poland remains one of the reasons for disagreements.
The European Court fined Poland, stating that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
The new government of Germany, sworn in on Wednesday, did not take on public commitments to stop the construction of Nord Stream 2 in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, despite demands from Poland and the United States.
American officials told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to stop the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a high-ranking US congressional staffer said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, a position that was confirmed by representatives of the G7 on Sunday.
Dmitry, look more carefully.
The view outside the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
They removed the wall between the kitchen and the room, so now the second window is partially visible.
Those who are not familiar with the initial plan are the ones who have doubts in general.
And I know these apartments very well and can see perfectly how they were redesigned.
Let everything be good for them.
It always surprises me when they write about means to clean the sink, toilet, windowsills, and faucets.
Do you only wash them once a year for Easter or something, so you have to really scrub them?
Just don't let it get dirty.
Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media wants to provide writers with residences.
In the future, the state will transfer federal property remaining from the Union of Soviet Writers and the Literary Fund of the USSR to the future Fund for the Support of Russian Writers.
"Writer's residencies will be created based on it," the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which will become the founder of the fund, told "Parliamentary Newspaper."
Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media is preparing a draft presidential decree on the establishment of a Fund to support Russian writers.
The explanatory note specifies that the fund will be entrusted with taking care, including the targeted use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Soviet Union of Writers and the Literary Fund.
"A significant number of real estate properties, previously owned by the Literary Fund of the USSR, including properties located in the writers' town of Peredelkino, the village of Komarovo in the Leningrad region, and others, have been transferred to the ownership of the Russian Federation," the press service of the Ministry of Finance reported to "Parliamentary Newspaper."
The draft decree requires that the charter of the Fund reflect that it "is created to promote literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers."
"The term 'creating conditions for creative activity' implies the establishment of writer's residencies in various regions of Russia based on the transferred property, where comfortable conditions for creativity would be provided," explained the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media to our publication.
520 rubles for one sliced tomato?
Cheese pie is literally a piece of dough from a package that costs 550 rubles.

Doctors warned about the danger of prolonged use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination.
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergey Tokarev warned about the danger of uncontrolled use of blood thinners after COVID-19 infection and before vaccination against coronavirus.
Doctor-therapist and immunologist Irina Yartseva explained that self-prevention of possible blood clots after COVID-19 can lead to a stroke.
Yartseva explained that blood thinning medications are not intended for everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, was in a hospital, or had complications detected.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood thinning medications that prevent excessive blood clotting) based on indications.
She reported that there is currently a fanaticism happening - everyone indiscriminately drinks anticoagulants for a long time and as a result, experiences complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding in the brain).
The chief preventive medicine specialist of the Urals Federal District, scientific director of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, and Doctor of Medical Sciences, Sergey Tokarev, told URA.RU in an interview that Russians are currently frequently using anticoagulants haphazardly before receiving the coronavirus vaccination.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the Internet and begin self-treatment.
There are citizens who, a week before vaccination, start taking anticoagulants by their own decision.
And during the preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice bruises.
He emphasized that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptom.
Potatoes have been named a superfood for protection against hypertension.

I had such a case.
A lady came to look at the apartment.
I came from another city to show it to her.
The announcement had detailed photos and a description of the apartment.
She remained extremely dissatisfied because there was no "luxurious" kitchen and "luxurious" balcony.
Auntie apparently has nothing to do, so she's watching other people's apartments while others are wasting their time.

The plumber who found money in the wall of the church will be paid 20 thousand dollars.
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the American state of Texas will be rewarded.
This is reported in a press release by the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at the large evangelical church Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising that devout Christians will receive wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cooley was repairing one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of bags of money and checks hidden under the insulation.
He handed over the discovery to the church and, according to him, did not even receive thanks from Austin.
I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing."
"We understand what you have done and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quotes him.
Apparently, the discovery is related to the theft that occurred at Lakeview Church seven years ago.
Then around 200,000 dollars in cash and 400,000 dollars in the form of checks, which were stored in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, a reward of $25,000 was offered for information about the criminals.
Justin Cole could not claim this amount as the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had previously allocated five thousand dollars as a reward and later received an additional twenty thousand dollars as a gift from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the honesty of a plumber.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Osteen regarding the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characterization "as a real person".
Therefore, that's why the attitude towards her is so negative.
And the point is not that "she is financially much richer than all the writers", as they write here.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone behaves as arrogantly and provocatively as this lady.

A new case of bird flu virus infection has been recorded in China.
A new case of human infection with the highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus has been recorded in China.
This was reported by the RTHK radio station with reference to the notification of the Hong Kong health authorities, according to TASS.
A 68-year-old resident of the Huizhou city district in the southern province of Guangdong, who kept domestic poultry, became infected with the virus.
His condition is assessed by doctors as critical.
The first human infection with the H5N6 virus strain in the world was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, citizens are required to present vaccination passports upon entry into the country.
In Brazil, it is mandatory to require a COVID passport from those entering the country, according to the decision made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF), Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Also included in the list of exceptions are individuals who have arrived from countries where the absence of a vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious, considering that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-Carnival and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," noted Barroso.
Earlier, Brazilian authorities required unvaccinated tourists to observe a five-day quarantine for coronavirus infection.
The scheme for complete protection against COVID-19 has been revealed.
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme for complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by administering an injection and using a nasal vaccine.
When applied intranasally, a large amount of immunoglobulin A is formed. This does not happen when the vaccine is administered by injection.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And after vaccination, the most antibodies formed inside us are immunoglobulins G.
"And if you receive both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is currently no decision on double vaccination," the doctor said.
The chief preventive medicine specialist of the Urals Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection is the possibility of no longer being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help those in such a case, as the protection of the body is expected to become maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that the new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic will be caused by the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, such a situation is observed in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Inna, um...
I spoke with the male dog (who has been dead for a long time already) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm home, food, affection, love, and play for a female in heat, then go ahead.
But the dog was trained and generally a smart one.
He chose my company and went home.
In the video, there is a method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not made up, believe me.
I slowed down many owners so they wouldn't run after the dog, even though they complained that 200,000 (Pomskies) were running away. I would take them by the hand and lead them in another direction.
In the end, "200 thousand" was chosen by the owner, not the dog that was running somewhere there.
Mass protests against vaccination opponents continue in Europe.
In the Austrian capital Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make COVID vaccination mandatory.
Starting from February of next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the government's healthcare policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held signs with the inscription "This is a false pandemic", "I will not get vaccinated" in their hands.
A large protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a COVID certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightclubs.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of several regions of the country against the backdrop of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, over a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The protest started peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
The group of demonstrators started throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolay S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor of medicine," probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I believe that they both deserve this title.
I only agree with Zakharova on one thing: Americans brought only death and looting to any country they appeared in.

The WHO has detected "Omicron" in dozens of countries already.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the new strain of coronavirus, "Omicron," has already been detected in 63 countries.
Several experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO reported on the rate of spread of the strain in their message.
According to the organization's data as of December 9th, the strain has already been detected in 63 countries across all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that he only started actively spreading it from the end of November.
WHO also expresses concern about the high rates of spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the Delta variant in terms of spread. The Delta variant, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, currently leads in all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the Omicron strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in Great Britain.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will replace "delta" in the coming months.
And the number of infected people in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially only a few hundred people are currently infected with "Omicron" in the Kingdom, according to estimates up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "omicron" strain, and at its peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope with it.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "Omicron" strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is currently unknown how the Russian "Sputnik V" vaccine will react to "Omicron" - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just started testing the Russian vaccine against the "Omicron" strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of aging?
It would be better to see in more detail the execution of your exercises.
It is unclear in the first exercise how to do it: sitting on your heels or kneeling as written, but then how to put your hands on your hips?
Or hands on hips?
Curious Squirrel, you are right, communication on the Internet is completely different, people communicate easily and naturally, but in person there is nothing to say.
And seeing a person in real life, perhaps it's not what you expected, it didn't touch you - hence the attitude.
When they meet their person, then their perspectives will change.
And again, the Soviet era is called "the time of demons".
Back then, people believed in God much more honestly than they do today.
And they were practically raised according to God's laws (love thy neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What is the ideology today - money at any cost.
Talkers like Globo have little faith (or none at all), but even if that's the case, the devil's time came in the 90s...
Our communal apartment in St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad, with Bolshaya Zelenina still maintains communication to this day.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to maintain warm relations of the older generation.
Perhaps this is because there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was still in effect.
Unfortunately, we are seeing each other more and more often at funerals.
Lara Angelskaya, come on, stop it!
Human infants, especially males, are strong, agile, energetic, they get angry, push, fight, and wrestle just like their little "siblings" in the wild!
It's just a pity that they're not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, and scratches are common, but they're not a boomerang!
And for what?
Did you push your little brother too hard without realizing your strength?
Are you always so agile that you never accidentally bump into anyone and never injure yourself?

$135 billion went into applications - Hi-Tech.
In 2021, user expenses in applications increased by 25% worldwide, while the number of downloads increased by 8%.
The most popular in the world turned out to be various video services.
Users downloaded the video editor CapCut the most, and spent the most on YouTube.
Both the number of app downloads and user spending within them showed significant growth during the period from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. User spending on applications has grown even more significantly: by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile application market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from lockdown and began post-pandemic recovery.
"Will such a "return to the physical" slow down the growth of the application economy? Not at all," the report's authors believe.
India has become the leader in terms of the number of application downloads, accounting for about 20% of all downloads.
The United States (9%) and Brazil (8%) are following her.
Gadget users on iOS, as before, spent more than users on Android: on iOS, 65% of all app expenses were incurred.
Among the applications, the video editor CapCut took first place in terms of the number of downloads for 2021.
Two Indian apps are following him: the video service MX TakaTak and the online shopping app Meesho.
Telegram is also included in the top 10 by number of downloads.
Overall, judging by the number of downloads, VPN services are popular among users (two of them - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN - are in the top 10), as well as services related to creating and broadcasting videos (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, two such services - Moj and SnackVideo - are also in the top 10).
"The authors of the report note that users spent the most in applications for live streaming and online streaming."
YouTube is leading here, and the top 5 in terms of user spending also include the video service TikTok, streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.
Telegram, Instagram, Zoom, and TikTok occupy the top spots in terms of the number of monthly active users, with the mobile version of Microsoft Office rounding out the top 5.
In Russia, the leader in terms of the number of downloads per year turned out to be the shopping application AliExpress.
Behind him are the Zenly service, which shows the location of friends, and the same CapCut.
Also included in the top 10 applications are: online karaoke StarMaker, online clothing retailer Shein, Maps for Minecraft PE application, online taxi ordering service DiDi, YouTube client Pure Tuber, retailer Dixy's application, and online store Samokat.
Around the world, people have adapted to the pandemic by transitioning to mobile living, which can be considered one of the main conclusions.
"The industries that helped people to be closer both virtually and in person have achieved the greatest success," commented Lexi Sidou, Head of Marketing Research at App Annie, on the report's results.
The revenue of the mobile gaming sector reached $90 billion in 2021. Casual and hyper-casual games, which have little or no plot and minimal video graphics, were the leaders in terms of downloads.
Count Masters, Project Makeover, and Bridge Race made it into the top 3 most popular games in the world.
In Russia, DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls, and Phone Case DIY are the leading games.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends of the next year, the company's analysts named the growth of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the increasing popularity of financial apps among Generation Z, such as Robinhood for investors, as well as further growth in popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians were warned about a new scam scheme.
Criminals have started looking for new maneuvers to commit fraud in video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to the product director of Ivideon, Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, scammers create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to accurately reproduce the behavioral characteristics of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using deepfake, attackers can make video calls to the victim's acquaintances or create a video featuring a copy of the person for distribution with the aim of blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, as a skilled villain can put people in ridiculous, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-scenarios," said the expert.
In turn, the leading systems engineer at Varonis, Alexander Vetkol, noted that people psychologically trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this can create specific risks in cases where it comes to technologies that use video.
David, I will add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all of this in a small town where the local mentality did not allow for dressing up too much and wearing short skirts, showing stockings and tights on legs.
This is a province, but there WAS such a product in the store.
In big cities, Muslim women would put on makeup and show their legs.
And so it is in Dushanbe, it is a big city and the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but there is no cosmetics.
Five actions are listed that will help prevent diabetes.
Problems with blood sugar levels are one of the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and they are wrong.
Diabetes can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a key role in preventing the development of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to plain water positively affects metabolism.
Sweet products increase the level of sugar in the blood to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The onset of the disease is influenced not only by improper nutrition but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Specialists recommend following a low-carbohydrate diet.
Such a diet will not only help to lose weight but also protect against sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of satiety, secretion of digestive juices, and increased food absorption.

Doctor Pavlova talked about "weekend migraines" in workaholics.
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in well-being on weekends.
The cause of feeling worse after working weekdays is often "weekend migraine", said well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the Systemic Medicine Clinic, Zuhra Pavlova, in her Telegram channel.
According to her words, workaholics often suffer from this, experiencing headaches, fatigue, and weakness on weekends.
Doctor Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue over the week, there are quite a few objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changes in conditions.
On weekends, our life changes fundamentally.
"We sleep for a long time, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more and drink less," the doctor argued. "Due to the lack of coffee, there is a slight withdrawal."
"Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and fatigue."
Late rising plays an additional role.
So, if you wake up three hours later than usual, you will experience a reaction called jet lag.
It occurs among travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factor plays a decisive role in worsening one's well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most on weekends.

South African scientists have announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omicron".
South Africa has announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omicron".
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, the level of neutralization of "omicron" corresponds to the vaccine's effectiveness of 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which raises doubts about the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, according to the research published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, specialists clarified that the medication can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the Omicron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in common products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
His excess in diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that an unfamiliar word listed as an ingredient in a product may be a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition, and glycemic index.
The label may contain several dozen names essentially referring to sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (sugar obtained from corn), fructose (fruit sugar), molasses (black treacle), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery products but also in ketchup, doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
As stated by Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter what the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
Chancellor of Germany Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years.
The new Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, stated that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonize the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil, and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"The Chancellor said that in 25 years, the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role."
Scholz noted that Germany continues to maintain its commitment to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas, both now and in the future, as this resource is currently of great importance for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the USA made a statement in which the support from Berlin for the energy transformation of Ukraine is fixed.
Earlier, the head of the German Foreign Ministry, Annalena Baerbock, stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the minister, within the framework of coalition negotiations and discussions of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also stated that the pipeline currently "does not comply with the regulations" of the European Union.
Thank you for the interesting photos!
In the year 1985, it was necessary to travel to those parts.

Hackers hacked the Twitter account of the Prime Minister of India.
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The criminals managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal tender and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
In Modi's office, they asked to ignore new messages.
Representatives of the Prime Minister stated that Twitter quickly responded and restored access to the account.
The page of the Prime Minister of India was already hacked in 2020 and urged to make donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum held on December 12 ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of the residents of New Caledonia voted against the independence of their territory during the referendum.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote became significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) of those who voted expressed support for New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against it.
The turnout was 43.90%, with over 80,000 residents of New Caledonia participating in the elections.
According to the French news agency France-Presse, "there was no doubt about the outcome of these elections" as supporters of independence called on voters not to participate in the vote.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that a new outbreak of COVID-19 on the archipelago hinders a full and "fair" election campaign.
Thus, this abstention paved the way for the third victory of supporters of French New Caledonia, after referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, and in 2020 - 53.3%.
As the separatists stated, they do not recognize the results of the latest vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12th, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to speak about the results of this referendum.
The topic of New Caledonia's independence has greatly revived in the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates spoke in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of presence of the European Union in the Pacific Ocean."
"New Caledonia must definitely remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated multiple times.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valeri Pecresse, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, calling on the people of New Caledonia to remain French.
On his part, Emmanuel Macron declared in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility".
However, the president added, "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire for the choice of the people of New Caledonia to be the choice of France."

Just don't forget that the food was NATURAL, so obesity wasn't as widespread as it is now.
And medicine was at zero - leeches, garlic, and infusions.
Now they would put them on their feet in an instant.
And the food has absolutely nothing to do with it.
In Turkey, the world's first unmanned aerial vehicle with laser weapons was tested.
Successful tests of the world's first drone with laser weapons were conducted in Turkey.
The "Eren" UAV was tested at distances ranging from 100 to 500 meters, according to "MIR24".
The device is capable of neutralizing explosive objects at a distance using a laser.
The maximum flight altitude of the novelty reaches 3,000 meters.
After passing the appropriate tests, the UAV must be put into service with the Turkish military, who will use it to destroy explosive devices without involving sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

WSJ readers criticized the article about the relations between Russia and the USA.
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and made a number of insulting statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "unite against Russia."
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"The article contains quite a lot of false information," cites RIA Novosti a comment from one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to "lose", and Ukraine is not our land."
"Another person noted that the USA and NATO allies will never engage in a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine."

An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands region.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was located at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation jet drones.
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, they will start creating ANKA-type jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
On December 11, this was reported by the external advisor to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, Alexei Arestovich.
That is, they are capable of acting against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aviation.
"They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the body and so on," Dialog.ua quotes him.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA aircraft, Arestovich explained that they are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpass it "in all characteristics".
"The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the factory at the end of next year," concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of a drone was carried out by the authorities of Turkey in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve, the Ukrainian General Staff classified information about the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the Joint Forces in Donbass.
On December 6th, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, announced that the construction of a factory for the production of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma company and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in the Kiev region for training personnel, as well as testing and servicing Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport.
Lions escaped at Changi Airport in Singapore.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals couldn't move away from him because of the protective fence installed nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival at the airport of employees from the Mandai Wildlife Group organization, responsible for all Singaporean zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that a lion had escaped from its owner in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, and was wandering the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home and no people were harmed.
Specialists warned of the risk of cancer due to vitamin B9.
Studies indicate that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned about this.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not experience a deficiency of folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose actually promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitchen advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if there is a significant deviation from this number in either direction.
Kitchen recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, always monitoring the dosage and avoiding flakes with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine named folic acid as a substance that slows down aging.
Since it, among other things, is contained in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
By April, around 75,000 people may die in the UK due to the Omicron strain.
Forecasts by British scientists show that due to the spread of the Omicron strain of coronavirus, up to 75,000 people may die in England in the next five months if restrictive measures are not tightened during the winter.
The newspaper The Guardian reported this with reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), according to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergencies at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, the country will record no less than 25,000 fatal outcomes due to the Omicron strain, and a total of about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will be admitting more than 2,000 infected patients daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be necessary to prevent overload of the National Health Service if the Omicron strain proves to be more contagious than the Delta variant and current vaccines are unable to prevent infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Security Agency informed that if the spread rate of the Omicron variant remains at its current level, around 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the Omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, there have been 1898 cases of Omicron variant coronavirus detected in the United Kingdom, of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
On December 9th, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, stated that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

Demand for superyachts has increased by a quarter in the world.
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records worldwide, despite calls to reduce carbon footprint and fight climate change.
In the world registry of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of the fight against the consequences of climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress worth 50 million pounds and above will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, their number is increasing.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there hasn't been such a frenzy in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before all these people used to go to the office and meet business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely and hold meetings on Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more just to have their yacht ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People simply crave freedom, while the super-rich can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, space travel, life on yachts, or flights on their own planes cause irritation in society, because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to take action and propose new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with such money mobility, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, not only the number of ordered super yachts impresses, but also their characteristics.
Out of 1200 ships, 27 have a stern length above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183-meter long yacht called REV Ocean.
After launching into the water, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a "moon pool" and a submarine designed for exploring the depths of the sea.
On existing super yachts, there are usually helipads, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, such as McGregor's fighter yacht, a platform for combat. Professor of Economic Anthropology at Indiana University, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has a symbolic value, considering that there are just over 2000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the carbon footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the footprint of the average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that were released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emissions footprint were attributed to his 162.5-meter yacht, Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Owners of super yachts do not elicit sympathy from other people when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no space for their giant vessels to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of colon cancer has been identified.
American scientists have determined the amount of alcoholic beverages per week that increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is written by the Daily Express publication.
Specialists have come to the conclusion that consuming four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the probability of developing a disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, among moderate drinkers, the risk of developing colon cancer is higher in men than in women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child.
Many, or rather all dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they do not realize how developed four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how intelligence develops in animals.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in the Sciencealert edition.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, they do not understand anything about politics, economics, and art, yet they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show better results in understanding human language, but there is currently insufficient statistical data for accurate conclusions.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and are not inferior to a two-year-old child in terms of learning ability.

In Ukraine, they are preparing for trade between the United States and Russia.
Analyst Alexander Kochetkov stated in his article for "Glavred" that the USA and Russia will be "negotiating" regarding Ukraine's entry into NATO.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations in the near future regarding guarantees from the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join wherever they want".
If you are offered something clearly unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send the proposer away.
"And there is a trade planned regarding Ukraine," wrote the analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia has no plans to attack Ukraine and is striving for dialogue with Kiev.
"They prepare secretly, quickly and immediately move on to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the grouping to be detected and opposing forces to be deployed," he noted.
China is stimulating the development of the railway transportation industry.
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France, and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition held in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, said company representative Hou Zhao Wen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with technologies that will ensure increased reliability and performance of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its export of railway transportation vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first double-decker high-speed electric trains developed in China for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
At a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary, and other European countries.
In November, a trial operation of a metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city airport.
The subway line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese industry for manufacturing equipment for railway transportation is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaosyan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
"This industry constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-end equipment production in the global market," said Feng Yaosyan.
After more than 60 years of intense work, conducting a series of independent research and development, China has created an advanced system for manufacturing railway equipment, with a full range of auxiliary facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosyan, the country ranks first in terms of railway electrification levels and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed early signs of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Golosheykin listed early signs of dementia in a conversation with Sputnik radio.
According to him, signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of mild cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, plan, and decreased level of abstract thinking.
"At present, there is a discussion about the fact that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development," said the specialist.
Golosheykin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that currently, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in a timely manner.
According to him, studying foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity and regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense memory and logical thinking engagement.
"Golosheykin said that there are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being debated in the scientific community."
"Golosheykin said that the World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking."
Earlier, a charity organization for dementia research in the UK stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 and over.
Doctors have named early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered problems with vision, which cause the patient to have difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing mental retardation that specialists have named is aphasia - a condition in which a person cannot find the right words to convey what they want to say.
The neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad.
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychological and neurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of a group of doctors created by the Georgian ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
"Stable problems are problems with mobility, coordination, and variability of character," said the specialist, noting that this does not exceed the normative framework and that the former president now needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"We call this neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia," noted Toizde, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7th, Saakashvili began to sabotage the receipt of medical assistance after prison service employees subjected him to disciplinary action.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to overturn the punishment and restore his rights.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain.
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, according to Europa Press agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the rally was approximately 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightclubs.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
On their posters, they used slogans to accuse the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the citizens' choice.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected in Spain, and over 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, restrictions are also planned to be introduced for the unvaccinated.
The government introduced bills on a unified system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit venues for mass events, cultural institutions, public catering facilities, and retail outlets with the presentation of either a vaccination certificate or proof of having recovered from the disease, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for train and plane trips.

Based on this, vaccination against the flu and this COVID is pointless.

Steep ascent: how the Chinese become skiers.
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country.
In China, they hope that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to participate in winter sports, which will allow President Xi Jinping's goal of collecting 1 trillion yuan to be achieved, but also contribute to the economic development of underdeveloped remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to infrastructure construction, landscaping work is also being carried out in the region: workers are planting trees.
There are over 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main long-term goal is to provide a comfortable and interesting vacation experience at Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regular visitors.
However, we are still far from that.
Game organization advisor Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year in winter, more and more Chinese people go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite significant changes, it will take many more years to create a skiing culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, near the location of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, and now none of the local residents are unemployed.
In the country, more and more stores are opening that sell clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, restaurants serving national cuisine dishes are opening.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan.
China aims to create a thriving winter sports industry, with its athletes becoming leaders in the largest international competitions, and its resorts and equipment reaching a global level.
More than 500 million people worldwide could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, according to the WHO.
More than 500 million people around the world could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed down progress towards universal access to healthcare services, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Coverage celebrated on December 12, WHO and WB have published two complementary reports.
In them, they noted that the pandemic led to disruptions in the provision of medical services and caused excessive strain on healthcare systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population with immunization has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and the World Bank emphasized that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for healthcare."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people have virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister was disconnected from the broadcast at the "Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House.
The speech of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology, Audrey Tan, during a panel discussion at the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" was translated into audio-only mode, according to the summit recording on YouTube.
The Reuters agency, citing sources, claims that the picture was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a different color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map that Mrs. Tan showed was created by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries around the world according to the degree of protection of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted in green on it as "free", while China, North Korea, Laos, and Vietnam were highlighted in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the discussion participants "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government."
China was not invited to the "Democracy Summit".
Reuters sources note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister may contradict the "One China" policy adhered to by Washington.
One of the agency's sources stated that after the demonstration of the map, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The "Summit for Democracy" organized by Washington took place on December 9-10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Yuri Averyanov stated that the summit had an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge."
They give you information as if they were cooking food, and there is rotten meat everywhere, but actually the meat remains with the butcher until the very last piece.

Sketches of a rural Muscovite.
Don't lump everyone together - there are bad people out there, and you may have specific grievances against them.
But what does the number of children, age, pension fund, and so on have to do with it?
Write that they are "scoundrels, they did not return the money".
But how many and when they have children is none of your business until they decide to hang those children on your neck.
And since this is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?
Probably, it's only in education that it's like this...
Selected (by themselves) parents dictate their own rules, blatantly disregarding the existing ones.
And if this will also concern other areas of life, such as the judiciary, etc.?
Laws are not written for them.
And what if dad still implements his own methodology of upbringing and education?
It's terrible and a very bad example for others.

The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council of China has issued a circular requiring the strengthening of prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land border crossings are located, in order to further prevent the importation of infections from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result of a COVID-19 nucleic acid test obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Those who arrive in cities where land border checkpoints are located must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be effective from the day when the corresponding administrative units of the provincial level determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, up to March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities where land border crossing points are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on the "sad conclusion" in the relations between Russia and the United States.
Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey Ryabkov assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington in an interview with "Izvestiya".
He noted that the long path of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not start yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but when it comes to some prospect of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion to the long journey we have taken with both the current administration, Trump, and Obama.
"The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's attempt to impose approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The Deputy Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that except for such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress is observed.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and Americans will listen to arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, stated during a meeting with the American Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
The virologist warned of the danger of vaccinating with a nasal preparation against COVID outside of hospitals.
Those who have been vaccinated with the nasal vaccine against COVID-19 may develop an allergy and require medical assistance, so the first vaccination points for this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology at Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
Organizing vaccination points for nasal vaccine in airports and shopping centers is easier, but I would only do it initially in medical institutions.
The point is that there is a possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable for a person to sit next to the doctor's office after that.
"Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work literally within a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to consider vaccination in shopping centers when experience in using the vaccine has been accumulated.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important for it to reach the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine may not reach its destination if the person being vaccinated blows their nose after the injection while having a stuffy nose.

They say that the truly faithful make up the church, Lama.
Do these true believers exist or not, we cannot know.

But no one should speak about themselves or about those who believe the same as them, that they are the only true believers.
Because if they can say about themselves that they are truly believers, then others can say the same thing.

Alexander M., could you please remind me what style the marathon was run in at the 2021 World Championships?
Do you see the ski track on which participants in the classic style race should finish?
Attention, question - what is Klebo doing to the right of Bolshunov and how does he want to get on the ski track if he was walking behind on the turn before the gate?
Being the "best finisher" at 1.5 km and after 50 km are two different things.
It was a long time ago...
I was there, but in fact I wasn't even a driver.
He had the right to drive, but he didn't know how to.

A column formed behind me.
I missed it.
Then the power steering belt broke.
Then the traffic police stopped us.

It needs to be towed.
The owner of the MAZ explained that he was drunk and the driver was inexperienced.
And to him - how drunk are you?

This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with the new variant of the infection in Scotland, and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK has reached 3137 people.

Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions.
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose any restrictions against Russia and not suffer oneself - said the official representative of the Kremlin on the air of the TV channel "Russia 1"."
Peskov claims that "everyone in the world understands this."
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, Herman Gref, is confident that this is impossible.

The residents of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France.
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave France.
On December 12, this was reported by the French TV channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of those who voted were against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
The level of participation in the voting on that day was very low: about 55% of the residents of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by separatists' calls to abstain from participating in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia expressed their opposition to independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence had already been held in the region.
The majority of the inhabitants supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers away from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia as its possession.
Around 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has a special administrative-territorial status.
There is an agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia from 1998, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a two-year interval.

The WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta".
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily believes that "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
However, there is data on the decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines against the new variant of COVID-19.
According to information as of December 9th, "Omicron" has been registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and significantly altered antigenic profile of the "Omicron" strain protein suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
"According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than with "delta"," says the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of "Omicron" infection in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than the "Delta" variant.
Two cases of Omicron strain infection have been registered in Russia.
"They had been previously immunized," reported the Gamaleya Center.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there is currently no reliable data indicating that the new variant of coronavirus is less dangerous than others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios were named for Zelensky.
Former member of the Ukrainian Parliament Vadim Denisenko outlined four possible scenarios for President Volodymyr Zelensky's future in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may lose the support of the West and also possibly compromise on the Donbass issue.
Denisenko spoke about this in a publication on the "Glavred" portal on Sunday, December 12th.
The first scenario, which Denisenko called the "perfect storm," assumes that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine after reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"Simultaneously, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export, as well as internal protests and power struggles with key financial-industrial groups," added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "a war against everyone."
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, when the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to such a situation, the leadership of Ukraine may compromise on Donbass, which could result in internal conflict within the country.
At the end of summer, Zelensky's positions will weaken, according to a former MP, the probability of such a situation is up to 50-55%.
The third scenario for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between dissatisfied groups of the population and the president Zelensky, which may lead to the seizure of control over the security forces and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
During such a crisis scenario, Zelensky will begin a "reformatting of power," added Denisenko.
Another scenario is turning Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
This can be caused by some event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event must be significant enough to trigger a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," said Denisenko.
Such a scenario could occur as a result of a natural disaster, technological catastrophe, or aggressive actions by Russia, according to the former deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has already rejected any possibility of "attacking" Ukraine more than once.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the USA who are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11th, the survey data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had dropped to record low levels, reaching 19.3%.
This is the lowest indicator since he was elected as the head of the state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the case of the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for the former president of the country, Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3% of all those surveyed expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great athlete, I didn't know that Elena Shushunova had passed away, it's very sad to find out.
I remember how I was rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul. For us, residents of the Primorsky Krai, it was a live broadcast, real time.
Such a passion, emotions were off the charts, I remember the joy when Elena won.

On TV, I once saw a documentary about one of the Central American countries, and there they were rolling watermelons onto the ship's deck like barrels.
The watermelons were of monstrous size.
I myself worked many times in my youth on cleaning and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and never encountered watermelons weighing more than a pud.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg straight from the garden and not before the beginning of August.
Balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, color: beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, article number: 12008).
Balconette bra with soft lace cups on frames.
The bottom part of the cup is reinforced with non-elastic transparent fabric.
The side inner part of the cup, in the area where the straps are sewn, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that prevents the lace from stretching.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the scalloped edge along the neckline and under the bust.
Vertical bones on the side panels made of single-layer microfiber prevent the fabric from twisting on larger sizes.
I didn't like the article at all, it was angry and venomous.

A student from HSE was detained on Red Square with a poster that had the hashtag #poetinrussiaismorethanpoet written on it.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was drawn up a protocol under an administrative article for repeated violation of the order of conducting a public event.
The first time he was detained was on January 23rd at Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry as a whole, but unfortunately, interest in it has been lost due to the decline of culture in Russia. There is also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their own poems on the internet using this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to clarify the circumstances of his detention and to further reveal the message of his work.
How did the police officers treat you during this and previous detentions?
What did they ask in the department and how did they comment on your action?
This time the employees were more polite, the detention was maximum, courteous, however funny it may sound in some context of this word.
At Pushkinskaya, OMON officers were taking people and doing it forcefully.
They asked in a standard way about the motives.
When they heard, they looked at it, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
Except for the monkey cage being ventilated on all four sides, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if after the campaign, people start writing their own poems under this hashtag, even if it's just a few people, I won't have spent these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, you can speak alone even in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak in the language of the surroundings so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through a translator.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian perfectly well and yet still resorts to using a translator.
And at official events, a transcript is made in the old-fashioned way with a pen, and the stenographer is not required to know multiple languages.
If you don't want to say a lot of words, just say no!

They are raised like that.

Researchers have explained how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and microelements that promote improved blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
Root vegetables contain vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the systems of the body to function.
In addition, potatoes help fight age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high fiber content, it is beneficial for the digestive system, and with regular consumption, it can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, root vegetables are better stewed or boiled rather than fried in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other foods with high glycemic index.
These are products with a high carbohydrate content that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the current product shortage can only be replaced by imports.
"Yandex will remove Lostfilm, Lordfilm, and other pirates from search results."
Candidates for departure.
"In 2015, the rights holders from the "RAEC/Media" cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites in the Russian internet, and most of them ceased to exist," says Karen Kazaryan, the director of the Internet Research Institute.
"But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks in part to regular domain name changes," he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in search results on both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Squid Game" and "Tenderness" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but judging by the video quality, it is a so-called screener (a pirated copy of the movie filmed in a cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the TV series "Univer. 10 years later" from the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-Media") is available.
Svetlana M., sorry, but I wouldn't give a damn if my son gets offended for his mommy or not.

Mattress Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190.
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two surfaces with different levels of softness - high hardness and slightly above average.
Only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exceptionally well, are included in the product.
Springs: in the center of the model, there is a block of independent springs called "micropacket".
This means that there are 2000 springs in the bed, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that provides a unique point adjustment.
"Micro package" is the highest frequency among all the variety of spring blocks of "Dimax", therefore it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface has latex, then the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long been considered a classic status, as it provides the mattress with not only orthopedic but also anatomical properties.
If the coil provides proper back support, then latex provides adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Cover: the model is supplied in a quilted knit cover with Aloe Vera.
At the client's request, it can be made either removable or stationary.
The overall height of the product is 27 cm, and the recommended weight limit for the sleeping area is 170 kg.
Guarantee and safety: warranty period - 3 years.
The mattress has received all necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in use.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, according to "Aktualnaya Kamera" on Sunday.
The goal of the missions launching in five years is to assess the habitability of the clouds of Venus and then search for life there.
For the Tartu project, Tartu scientists proposed tools for measuring the acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Let's assume that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth's or different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
"If it is different, then it is possible that it becomes more likely that life originated on Earth," said the leader of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project, Mihkel Päusalu.

"Multiverses will change Russian business."
The topic of metaverse became popular in the fall of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
So, business in Russia, like in the rest of the world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
The multiverse should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the conditions of the pandemic, as people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of businesses' desire to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
From the third one - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitizing assets, when any rights, securities, works of art, and even money are transferred to a digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too fatty and harmful.
Of course, we will have both traditional Olivier salad and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one is forcing me to overeat everything at once.
You can eat by the spoonful, try it - and that's enough.
After all, there really are ten days off ahead, so you can prepare any tasty and healthy dishes.

The British economist was unable to provide a forecast for the year 2022.
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to provide a forecast for 2022, as he believes that such attempts will fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend could change the turnover.
He believes that the most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, with inflation coming in second place.
O'Neill also admitted that he doesn't know whether the increase in prices for goods is temporary or not.
As indicated by the specialist, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of infinite generosity of central banks has already outlived itself" and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policies may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
"Moreover, attention should be paid to the issue of increasing productivity, as well as the rise in poverty levels and climate change," summarized O'Neill.
Earlier, the head of the Global Research Department at "Opening Investments", Mikhail Shulgin, reported that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate in 2022 remain, but the potential for growth will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar exchange rate, Shulgin named the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices, and concerns against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.
I am forced to agree.
But one thing is pleasing: if you compare yourself to yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.
Now it's better.
There is progress, but it is sluggish.
There is still such a problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people are not aware of them.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP.
According to statistical data from the Russian Automotive Market Research agency (NAPI), Russians spent 2.784 trillion rubles on purchasing new cars during the first 10 months of 2021, which is 28% more than during the same period last year.
To understand the scale, approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the government to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization countries, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
Korean brand Kia is the leader in terms of income in the Russian market.
In 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the previous year.
For the related Kia brand, the growth is even more significant for Hyundai - over 35%, and the revenue from car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is leading in terms of increasing the average weighted price of a car - over the year, Hyundai's price has increased by almost 21% to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely, and Mercedes-Benz have had stronger price growth dynamics.
At the same time, sales volumes for Korean brands did not increase significantly: according to statistics from the Committee of Automobile Manufacturers of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars during the same period than the previous year.
Hyundai - almost by 12%.
Japanese Toyota closes the top three leaders in terms of sales volume in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than the previous year.
Mercedes-Benz follows the Japanese with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both sales volume (by 37%) and the average price of a car (almost by 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz is experiencing good sales growth and an increase in the average price, more so than BMW, which leads to a greater increase in financial capacity," explained NAPI CEO Tatiana Arabadzhi.
Chinese brands are demonstrating fantastic sales growth rates and have significantly increased their financial capacity this year.
The Russian Lada demonstrates average market indicators in terms of income growth dynamics (plus 28%), with Russians spending 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
Companies whose car sales in units fell in 2021, including Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Nissan, are at the same level of financial capacity as last year.
UAZ is even in the negative - over 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand, compared to 12.4 billion rubles the previous year.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of auto components and production disruptions that have affected the entire global automotive industry, car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" raised the cost of Lada models seven times in a year, the latest increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
They regularly rewrite price tags for their products and other car manufacturers.
The volumes of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation and the desire of car manufacturers to recoup past losses also contribute to this, according to experts.
In conditions of a shortage of cars, I think that many car manufacturers were able to partially shift the costs of past periods onto the consumer, which they could not previously include in the price of cars.
"VTB Capital analyst Vladimir Bespalov says about the automotive industry."
I believe that car manufacturers feel very good financially right now, maintaining high sales margins.
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of car prices observed during 2021, with prices for new cars rising faster than inflation, according to the expert.
"In the long term perspective, the market will grow both in quantity and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complication of the construction of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov."
As the supply increases, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, car manufacturers will be able to generate their income through volumes, notes independent automotive consultant Sergey Burgazliev.
"Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now striving to get the maximum profit from each sold car," notes Burgazliev.
An increase in the volume of car production is not expected for at least the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is fueled by citizens' uncertainty about the future.
Against the backdrop of the current market situation, cars have become a good investment opportunity - an expert notes that a car purchased a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its initial cost.
Biden spoke about the deployment of US troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion.
The US leadership has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of Russia's "invasion".
US President Joe Biden made such a statement.
"There have never been such plans," said the head of the White House in response to a journalist's question about whether the US had rejected such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he emphasized that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the US will redeploy forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Estonia).
"We will have to deploy more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to defend them against any aggression from Russia," said Biden.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow has no intentions of invading the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey to Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."
I immediately leave such interviews.
If during the interview they already want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink some unclear stuff and even wash a cup - it's scary to imagine what it will be like at work.
I will find myself a normal place without a layer of HR where you can immediately talk to the manager.

If a fraudster calls from a similar number, pretending to be a "police officer" or another law enforcement agency, it is not effective to immediately hang up, but rather to add them to the blacklist, which is likely to be too late.
Because to confirm his lie about being involved with the power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to scare and persuade.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
Here's such nonsense...
I really don't believe that it happened like that.
They don't know what else to come up with, whom to blame.
They reached the Queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame except for the very few...
Wouldn't it be easier to leave people alone and not force them, of course, if our leaders care about their people?
Perhaps all strains of the virus will disappear...
As in Japan... before the elections, the influence was weakened and the number of infections decreased...
"A set of wool for felting "Assortment No. 2" 100% merino wool, 4x10g."

Maria Kartashova, what does "in response to this" mean?
I don't voice my thoughts, I mentally curse all of you.

And from the looks of it, I can even smile at you.
But I remember that thought is material!

The film "Faust" by Alexander Sokurov won the European "Oscar" for Best Editing.
The Russian film "Unclenching Fists", nominated for an Oscar, received the award for Best Editing from the European Film Academy (also known as the "European Oscar"), according to "Moskovsky Komsomolets".
The jury of the competition, who voted online due to the difficult epidemiological situation, appreciated the outstanding skill of the film creators.
The film "Quo Vadis, Aida?" by Jasmila Žbanić (Bosnia) received the maximum number of awards this time.
The main character of the film is a translator for the UN mission who tries to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Unclenching Fists" directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), this film tells the story of the complex relationships between a domineering father and his adult children who want to break free from his control in North Ossetia.
Earlier it was announced that this film was nominated for an Oscar as the best foreign language film.
As regular friendly meetings between the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey show, in my opinion, you are not quite up to date.
Just yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KamAZ.
