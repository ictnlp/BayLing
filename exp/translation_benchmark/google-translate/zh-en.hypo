Students play the leading roles at the Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference, and the research results are mind-opening - Xinhua English.news.cn
Use air to wash hands, breath to judge diseases, and accurately search for the source of smog Last night, at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University&#39;s 2016 Academic Annual Conference, a series of mind-blowing academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and their research covers environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education and other major fields. Starting from a curious idea, students have created many high-end inventions with application value , some of which have won domestic and international awards.
Biosensors: Your Home Medical Examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smartphone-side biosensor, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
&quot;You only need to exhale lightly, and this set of instruments can initially detect the health status of your body from the composition of your exhaled gas.&quot;
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
The smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
And this set of biosensors uses graphene, a new type of material, whose target is chemical elements, and its keen &quot;sense of smell&quot; allows it to reflect the health status of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Lamp: Doctor&#39;s High-Energy Eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won a silver medal in the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of master students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
&quot;Early detection and inadequate resection of many diseases are related to the lights used in doctors&#39; operating rooms.&quot;
Shen Junfei said, for example, in the early detection of cancer, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This intelligent surgical light has four lamp panels, which can enhance the distinction of different tissues under the light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This smart surgical light has been tried in hospitals such as Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children&#39;s Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, rub some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer at most, but Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of &quot;air hand washing device&quot;.
Just by standing on the sink of the device, our body weight can compress the air out.
&quot;It&#39;s like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap that combines with the water.
In this way, we can wash our hands clean! &quot;
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to be driven by our own gravity, which can not only ensure the degree of washing, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out from many top universities in the world and won the only gold award.

A certificate that is very meaningful - first aid certificate
This is one of the most important skill certificates besides the driver&#39;s license!
Popularize it: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue when an emergency occurs, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after the accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when first aid is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, golden four minutes!
So how important it is for people around you to know first aid!
When someone around us falls down, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of just standing there motionless and doing nothing, this feeling of helplessness is too scary.
&quot;In China, according to our official statistics, three million people die unexpectedly every year, and the most dangerous is called cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
Seventy to eighty percent of casino hotels in Las Vegas can be saved, and less than 1% in Shanghai and Beijing. &quot;
This is what First Response founder Lu Le said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, pinching will have no effect.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save the person.
I find that very few of us have the awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens, it will be too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can be timely in the face of emergencies react.
It might even save someone&#39;s life!
First aid certificates can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is to record my goal to be completed before the age of 25. It was a few months ago that I added the first aid certificate to the goal list, but it is indeed completed!
Then I want to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw a diving first aid certificate in Xiaohongshu before. It seems that I have to have a first aid certificate before I can take the exam. So in fact Still very useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER#

Why can&#39;t #NAME# be written clearly?
13 yuan for one?
#PRS_ORG# missed delivery of food yesterday, this time I will eat a shrimp dumpling! ?
Because obviously when I entered the code before, it was valid
Let me talk about the conclusion first. I personally think that &quot;Four Seas&quot; is an all-round bad movie, in every sense.
But if you want to say that this movie has no bright spots, it&#39;s not that at least the soundtrack is very good.
There are many kinds of bad movies. The one that makes you fall asleep in the cinema is counted as one, and the one that makes you feel righteous indignation after watching it. &quot;Four Seas&quot; is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience. It can be used countless times. Ways to ignite your anger.
At the point of insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a Greek novel. It is indescribable and has many loopholes like the windbreaker on Xiao Ma.
Even after watching it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you will find that it is actually a piece of shit.
Let me briefly talk about some plots that are difficult for me to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, and lives with his grandmother.
Her grandma had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see snow in a minivan.
Elderly people sitting in a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow? ?
He and his father are very relieved about this.
Then the old man stopped writing.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship, how did the hostess and his brother get the business license?
Why can the gangsters of the speeding party on the island easily close a section of the mountain road? ?
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road was parked on the side of the road, and even the truck driver couldn&#39;t find it.
The sense of props is too obvious.
Why did a gangster with bad credit and suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary policeman?
Why didn&#39;t you call the police in the face of loan sharks? In the movie, the police specifically asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn’t know how to use a room card to open the door in a hotel, and then arranges forcibly to find the hotel owner and sit outside the room door to sleep overnight?
This kind of inexplicable plot is full of the whole film, because the plot is so outrageous that it makes me painful to recall them.
In addition to the plot, what is worse is the theme of the movie, or the movie has no theme at all, which is a hideous stitch monster.
At the beginning of the film, you would think that he wanted to make a comedy film. After more than 20 minutes, you guessed that it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through the film, you thought it might be a drama film that wanted to reflect the difficulty of survival for young people in small towns. I didn&#39;t know what I was watching, and what followed was deep doubts about myself, why did I go to the cinema to watch the poop after Chinese New Year.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcycle rider, then use inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie will succeed step by step.
If you want to make a romance movie, then you should honestly talk about the grievances and entanglements between the young people in the small town who like to ride motorcycles and the waitress girls.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot can&#39;t appear to be contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng&#39;s new motorcycle has just been burned, and he can still sing), so you can&#39;t open up some brain holes that even Kennedy can&#39;t stand.
As for the heroine who is obviously not mentally handicapped but behaves like a 5-year-old child in some respects, I really don&#39;t know if this is due to acting skills or the director&#39;s request.
Another point I can&#39;t understand is why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen on adding car crashes to his own movies?
Such a movie is arranged in the Spring Festival file, is it to create trouble for the audience?

Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou shaft wall brick module equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a professional manufacturer of concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, inspection well block machinery and well wall module machinery in China, from semi-automatic to fully automatic production lines.
Through years of practice and development, we now have a series of equipment and supporting devices with excellent quality, mainly producing hydraulic, mobile and fully automatic inspection wells.
Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou shaft wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Features and advantages of inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
Yixin inspection well block brick machine equipment is widely used in new masonry materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
Such as: various inspection wells for drainage and water storage facilities, storm water outlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the upper, lower, left, and right sides of the modules are all concave-convex groove structures, and the combined masonry forms a chain lock.
The shear resistance of the shaft wall is much better than that of the flat friction masonry.
The module is a hollow structure. After the combined masonry, the longitudinal holes are connected, and the horizontal holes are connected. After the hole cores are poured, a cast-in-place concrete network structure is formed, which plays the role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The modules are equipped with grooves for inserting ribs vertically and horizontally, and horizontally lying ribs and longitudinally inserting ribs correspondingly improve the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, sinking, water leakage, etc. The well wall module has stable mechanical properties, simple operation, and standard forming dimensions.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment intelligent control is equipped with data input and output devices, one-touch touch LCD monitors the whole process of mechanical operation, and realizes ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system .
The mechanical hydraulic system of the shaft wall module adopts single-cylinder hydraulic pressure, conveying, and double-cylinder hydraulic pressure, conveying.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the influence of main engine vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment distribution box advances and the mold box is demoulded and rises, the storage box door is closed, and the pallet is automatically conveyed, all of which are independently completed by the hydraulic system, thereby reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, seals and hydraulic parts, and the comprehensive performance of the equipment is guaranteed to be stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration platform of the shaft wall module is made of integral plate steel, and the table surface is wire-cut and molded without welding points, so that the stuffing box can swing freely and guide, fully reducing mechanical wear and tear.
The mold load is reduced, and the filler is combined to increase the vibration amplitude. It adopts integrated, fully synchronized, table vibration and mold vibration to ensure the vibration effect.
The shaft wall module mechanically excites the vibration machine, and the computer automatically controls the amplitude to adjust the amplitude according to the cost performance of raw materials, without wearing and braking, thereby prolonging the service life and reducing costs.
The shaft wall module has dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing Vocational School pilots modern apprenticeship system, students are prospective employees of enterprises - Xinhua English.news.cn
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the &quot;modern apprenticeship&quot; talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. The students who receive the pilot training will also have the status of apprentices. Unit employees.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of secondary vocational schools be standardized, and that the dual identities of apprentices of secondary vocational school students and prospective employees of enterprises be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign tripartite agreements. 18-year-old apprentices must sign an agreement with the apprentice, guardian, school and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, and protection of rights and interests of apprentices on the job.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt the form of modern apprenticeship and cooperate with cooperative enterprises to carry out pre-job training and transfer training for enterprise employees.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes the training system as a pilot cycle, and the students&#39; internship time in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the on-the-job internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotation training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will determine 60 municipal-level secondary vocational modern apprenticeship pilots in three batches, each pilot will have about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
According to the principle of first piloting and then implementing, and gradually advancing from point to area, explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education to effectively improve students&#39; job skills and improve the employment rate and quality of students&#39; counterparts.

South African doctor: Although the transmission of Omicron is strong, most of them are mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus is milder than that of the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, a medical organization composed of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province, South Africa reported that the symptoms of the new crown patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as physical symptoms. Flu-like symptoms such as aches and coughs.
The group&#39;s director, Dr Unben Pillay, said he sees dozens of patients a day, but none have yet required hospitalization.
&quot;They were able to control the disease at home and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation,&quot; Pillay said.
That includes older patients and those with pre-existing health conditions that are more likely to become seriously ill from the coronavirus, he said.
By contrast, he said, during the last wave of the Delta outbreak, the COVID-19 patients he treated had “difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many are hospitalized within days.&quot;
In the two weeks since the omecroron variant was first reported in southern Africa, other doctors have shared similar experiences.
While it will be weeks before enough data is collected, observations by doctors and early evidence offer some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of the COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in recent weeks were seriously ill, half of the severe cases in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospitalization time was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; the recent COVID-19 Only 3% of patients died, compared with 20% of cases in South Africa&#39;s early outbreak.
&quot;Currently, almost all indications point to a milder disease,&quot; said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health Research, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports.
He added: &quot;It&#39;s still early days and we need to get late-stage data.
Typically, hospitalizations and deaths happen later, and we&#39;re only two weeks into this wave. &quot;
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing how well current vaccines and treatments work.
While Delta remains the dominant coronavirus strain worldwide, cases of Omicron are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, Gauteng saw a 400 per cent increase in new cases detected in the first week of December, with tests showing the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 per cent of cases.
Thanks to the supporters today, all 80 boxes have been given away!

Educational Current Review: What to rely on to save abducted children?
If we compare the famous public service advertisement slogan &quot;If you don&#39;t buy or sell, you don&#39;t kill&quot;, then, in a good environment where there is no need to &quot;accept trafficking&quot;, mass prevention and mass governance, and nationwide anti-trafficking will make trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly. High, such crimes will not happen frequently.
Recently, the Anti-Trafficking Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency information release platform for missing children.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for releasing information on missing children and to find abducted children in a timely manner.
Hearing that this app is called &quot;Reunion&quot;, I feel very warm.
The new technology means are not only named &quot;literature&quot; and full of feelings, but also properly used informatization, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-abduction law enforcement is to find the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list many &quot;big words&quot;.
But before the abduction case is solved, the personal safety of the victim should be given priority.
Matters should be prioritized, and under the urgent purpose of &quot;rescue&quot;, such as &quot;whether child abduction should be punished by death&quot; and other controversial topics can be put aside for a while and discussed carefully; but the matter of rescuing abducted children, etc. no.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, traffickers are used to leaving the crime site as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the abduction operation is delayed for one minute, the child may be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one point.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the &quot;Reunion&quot; platform that directly helps to solve the case and find the child.
After all, &quot;fighting abduction&quot; is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
Combating crime and protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous law enforcement, there is no need to implement the care of &quot;protecting the young and helping the weak&quot;.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be done better from the family to the society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three is resting at a train station, the parents are sound asleep, and when they wake up, they find that the child is missing.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have adequate self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, one should be at least reasonably protective.
The two parents take turns to rest, or put the child under safe protection, which are the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police&#39;s crackdown on trafficking crimes, the party that buys abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single wrongful act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to my country&#39;s &quot;Criminal Law&quot;, the statutory starting point for the crime of abducting and trafficking children is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the penalty may be death and confiscation of property.
The starting point is high and the maximum penalty is severe. Under the general trend of &quot;lighter punishment&quot;, the crime of abducting and trafficking children is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
But there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts in raising children and weak legal awareness.
Legal education for these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on official strict law enforcement.
If there is a widespread &quot;market&quot; for abduction and traffickers, greedy for profit, and constantly innovating trafficking methods, forming a &quot;fighting&quot; situation with law enforcement, the anti-trafficking operation will inevitably fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, getting rid of outdated concepts and popularizing common sense of the law will also help eradicate the crimes of trafficking and buying children.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil, with five grades.
Virgin olive oil or natural olive oil is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruit by mechanical cold pressing and filtering to remove foreign matter.
There are three levels of acidity:
Extra virgin olive oil (Extra Virgin): It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and it is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a light and pleasant vegetal aroma, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
High-quality virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): slightly higher acidity, but not more than 2%, pure and aromatic taste.
Ordinary Virgin: The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained after refining virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or &quot;secondary oil&quot;.
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Ordinary olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to reconcile the taste and color. Its acidity is below 1.5%, and it is transparent and light golden yellow.
Refined olive oil or olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): It is olive oil extracted from pomace by dissolution method and refined.
If you have read the classification of grades, you should have discovered that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You should know that olives are like grapes for making wine. Olives from different production areas and varieties of olives will produce olive oils of different standards.
The best places to grow olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable climate conditions such as soil and temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation required for olive growth.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only be planted sporadically in suitable habitat areas.
Main producing areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc. have similar climates to Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc. in far southern latitudes.
Olive picking months:
From March to June every year is the time for olive trees to bloom and set fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, and the fruit transitions from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to next February is the fruit picking season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutrition Facts of Olive Oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the fats found so far.
Democratic summit ends, Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The online &quot;Summit for Democracy&quot; (Summit for Democracy) convened by US President Biden and attended by governments, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing speech, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said he plans to hold a second global &quot;democracy summit&quot; next year.
Taiwan government representative and political councilor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
&quot;We know how hard the job is before us,&quot; Biden said.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because I&#39;ve said before that, as this summit has shown, democracies are everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the smoldering fire of freedom that burns in the hearts of people and people everywhere. &quot;
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
&quot;As leaders of government, we have a duty to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reforms, transparent and accountable governance, more resilient to the buffers and shocks of authoritarian forces, and those who want to act in the public interest,&quot; he said. People who were naked in pursuit of power before.&quot;
The themes of the second day of the &quot;Democracy Summit&quot; were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and fighting against authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with &quot;International Human Rights Day&quot;.
In his opening speech that day, UN Secretary-General Guterres also stated that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially the challenges brought about by emerging digital technologies.
&quot;Now is the time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience,&quot; he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including using all the tools the technological revolution has to offer. &quot;
Speaking to the summit via pre-recorded video, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Kwan-chung reminded attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China&#39;s ethnic minorities such as Uyghurs and Tibetans.
&quot;For too long, the world has accepted China&#39;s rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable,&quot; he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. &quot;
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
&quot;Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don&#39;t want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don&#39;t recognize the threat to our democratic values,&quot; he said.
And that&#39;s why we failed.
This is why we must change. &quot;
During the roundtable discussion on &quot;Fighting Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming the Value of Democracy&quot;, Tang Feng, Political Councilor of Taiwan&#39;s Executive Yuan, released the &quot;National Statement&quot; via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of fighting against autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the new crown epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: &quot;When Taiwan&#39;s democracy is in its infancy, we have always been firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and we have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
Democracy around the world is showing signs of retreat amid the pandemic as authoritarian governments everywhere rationalize human rights abuses in the name of public health and the collective good.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without closing the city, and defeat disinformation without taking it off the shelves. &quot;
While the schedule for the second day of the &quot;Democracy Summit&quot; was going on, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries including China and North Korea that were found to have seriously violated human rights. Surveillance technology facilitates investment restrictions by Chinese companies that violate human rights.

Hello, the drool chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I will not be able to persist, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly. In fact, the price is often directly proportional to the friendliness. If you can’t tell, then the expensive ones are usually friendlier than the cheap ones. This kind of “beginner” is actually industrial waste.
Their strength is very low, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, hard balls cannot withstand it, and it is difficult for masters to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence are——tennis is so difficult, I know you can’t learn it, and I know you are not willing to buy expensive ones, so I get a cheap one to fool you, if you play it twice, you won’t play again, so This racket is cheap, and you don&#39;t feel bad about it.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have improved, and then come to me to buy expensive ones, and I will make money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price to buy a better second-hand racket, choose Prince, or Dunlop. These two brands are not well-known enough, so good rackets can’t be sold at the price. New racquets of 500 or 600 are good. Second-hand 200 yuan, wouldn&#39;t it be nice to have a thousand yuan auction?
It&#39;s very friendly to novices, but once you pass the novice stage, it&#39;s tasteless, but most people, especially girls, can&#39;t pass the novice stage.
The order has been delayed multiple times for delivery
Could you please help me follow up?
put off
Thanks
That is, in fact, I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Did you ignore that order?

Girl uses archery target to raise money for sister: &quot;It&#39;s okay to think it&#39;s a flesh wound&quot; - Xinhua English.news.cn
A girl in Wulin Square in Hangzhou stood in front of a large wooden board with the words &quot;Human target, ten yuan per arrow&quot; written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of &quot;Hangzhou girl willing to act as an &#39;archery target&#39; to raise donations for her sister&quot; hit the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person in Hangzhou Wulin Square. The words &quot;Human target, ten yuan per arrow&quot; are written on the wooden board, indicating that passers-by can use bows and arrows to shoot after paying.
This behavior caused heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the person in charge of publicity at the Xiacheng Sub-bureau of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to a reporter from the Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl was raising money for her sister before she made such an aggressive move, but this kind of behavior is not worth advocating. He left the local police station yesterday.
Girl admonished for street &quot;archery target&quot; fundraising
In the picture posted on the Internet, a long-haired girl is standing in front of a large wooden board in the shape of &quot;Ge&quot;. The words &quot;Human target, ten yuan per arrow&quot; are written in black ink on the wooden board. In front of her is written on another board. There are bank accounts, WeChat and Alipay accounts, etc.
The picture sparked controversy after going online.
Some netizens believed that this move was &quot;begging for eyeballs&quot;, and many netizens expressed sympathy for this.
&quot;We discovered the situation when we patrolled the square at around 10:00 am on the 23rd. At that time, there were already a lot of onlookers.&quot;
Police from the Tianshui Police Station near the incident said in an interview with local media that there were two girls who set up the stall, both around 20 years old, and they were young and beautifully dressed.
Among them, the girl who was the &quot;human flesh target&quot; was crying all the time, begging passers-by to play the game; the other girl was helping and yelling, saying that her friend&#39;s sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery fees, please help.
&quot;We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister&#39;s leukemia treatment.&quot;
Last night, the person in charge of publicity at the Xiacheng Sub-bureau of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl, named Ji Jiali, was raising donations for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still required more than 300,000 yuan, he couldn&#39;t think of a good way to raise funds for a while, so he did this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was the target and the other was the underdog, but they did not participate in it. No one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but some people watched and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police appraised by the public security department, the bows and arrows used were not within the scope of control.
The person in charge said, &quot;This kind of eye-catching fundraising method is not advocated.&quot;
After being warned by the police station, she has left the police station.

What is the hottest in 2021?
Definitely the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win prizes?
Some time ago, there was an article &quot;Look! The article &quot;Olympic Games where project managers can hit gold medals&quot; is very popular. It mentions that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: Moving bricks, business trips, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers. Fighting fires and taking the blame , Apologizing is even easier.
An article that seems to be a joke, but it also expresses the daily bitterness of project managers, which represents the powerlessness of the current project management work.
And those who are engaged in project management work gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of the predicament at work.
Judging from the increasing number of applicants for PMP (Internationally Certified Project Management Professional Qualification) every year, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management capabilities through learning.

The number of PMP certificate holders has been increasing year by year in the past 10 years, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the past &quot;old experience&quot; to do things. On the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.

Nhan Dan Online - GCC to tackle common challenges
Stopovers for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Crown Prince Mohammed&#39;s first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
Amid the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic ties and imposed a sweeping embargo on Qatar, which it accuses of supporting terrorist groups and has close ties to Iran.
The diplomatic tension has seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC, negatively affecting the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, with the Gulf states signing an agreement to move towards &quot;unity and stability&quot; mediated by the US and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore ties with Qatar, with both countries appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
The reconciliation of differences between the Gulf Arab countries to restore relations with Qatar stems from the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi crown prince&#39;s visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens of the two countries and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US$5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 cooperation memorandums of understanding worth US$30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince&#39;s visit to the Gulf countries comes as Iran and world powers try to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) -- an agreement that Gulf Arab states have condemned for failing to resolve their missile problems with Iran. agreement to be negotiated.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term &quot;rival&quot; and regarded Iran&#39;s nuclear program as a &quot;threat&quot; to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that failing to address the Iranian missile issue and taking no action to curb Iranian activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia has entered into direct talks with Iran against the background that nuclear talks between the major powers and Iran failed to meet the wishes of the Gulf countries.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first among GCC countries since the end of a dispute between some members and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the achievements of diplomacy that have contributed to the restoration of the GCC&#39;s unity, while at the same time proposing measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf states.

It is said that the exhaust sound of supercars in Johor Bahru is the loudest!
The car brought to you by our team this time is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the replacement model of Murcielago—Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgits, the annual road tax is more than ten thousand ringgits, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Forget it, I don’t know. The data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h. It’s probably because my myvi will reach 100km/h when it reaches 30km/h, eh.
The low body, aggressive scissor doors, huge air intakes around the body and the 6.5 V12 engine that can be seen under the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to say too much about the description of the car model, just Google it yourself, the editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
Too much attention, everyone is watching wherever you go, very uncomfortable! (actually a bit cool)
The fuel cost for 1km is around RM1 (the car owner doesn’t care at all)
You need to practice the posture of getting on and off the car, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you will not be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is so loud that you will be deaf immediately after getting out of the car. (but still cool)
The body is too big, and it will be very narrow in a normal parking space. I am afraid that it will be knocked by the car next door when it opens the door!
It&#39;s a bit lonely, because there are no rivals on the road (I said it myself, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don&#39;t get me wrong, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for your car, welcome to contact us!
More car information you don&#39;t know, just in The Car Guide / People&#39;s Automobile Journal
Involved in a car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are believed to be familiar to car fans. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
A few days ago, foreign countries knocked down a million sports car 911 and tens of millions of supercar Chiron in just a few minutes!
Look at the results, expensive is justified!
Let the university spirit and the spirit of the times resonate at the same frequency - Xinhua English.news.cn
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school-running concepts and value pursuits accumulated over a long period of time in the development process of a university, which is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world&#39;s first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For our country&#39;s university, it rose in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. He advocated the value concept of &quot;enhancing morality to help the world, cultivating Qi Zhiping&quot; and the patriotic responsibility of &quot;building a strong country through learning&quot;.
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious, and the competition in education, science and technology, and talents is intensifying on a global scale. As an important &quot;supply side&quot;, higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of the &quot;Overall Plan for Coordinating and Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-class Disciplines&quot; not only demonstrates my country&#39;s confidence and determination to move from a country with higher education to a country with higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities. .
How to strive to become one of the world&#39;s leading universities in a relatively short period of time, speed up the establishment of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and realize &quot;overtaking on a curve&quot;?
In addition to firm goal confidence, self-confidence in path, and self-confidence in ability, colleges and universities should give full play to three advantages: one is the latecomer advantage, through continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve academic level and school quality. Significant improvement; the second is cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in five thousand years, and promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, build brands, and enhance image; the third is institutional advantages, giving full play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries In order to provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate to catch up with the world&#39;s advanced level, it will strengthen the drive of goals, gather consensus and joint efforts, and optimize the allocation of resources.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university, and each school must demonstrate its individuality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
School-running characteristics should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their own unique goal orientation, school-running tradition and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in running a school: First, highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated education environment integrating science and education, and school-enterprise integration, and form a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; It is to highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, create an institutional environment for interdisciplinary research, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; the third is to highlight the characteristics of the school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of Pan-Zhejiang University Industry-University-Research Cooperation System.
In this process, it is especially important to always stick to the university spirit and let the university spirit and the spirit of the times resonate at the same frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of &quot;seeking truth and innovation&quot;, the common values of &quot;diligence, moral cultivation, discernment, and sincerity&quot; and &quot;inclusiveness of rivers and rivers, enlightenment of truth and virtue, openness to the people before the people, and the establishment of our country&quot; together constitute the The latest expression system of Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural heights, and gather spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, &quot;Hai Na Jiang He&quot; emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, embodies the mind of &quot;the world&#39;s talents are for my use&quot;, and is manifested in absorbing the high-quality concepts of running schools and educating people from world-renowned schools; The spirit of benevolence means that while pursuing the truth, universities should also accept the cultivation of virtue and the cultivation of personality; For reform and development, to reform the old and reform the old; &quot;Building our country&quot; emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, and it is said that the university should always share the prosperity and humiliation with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
&quot;The wise hear in the silent, the wise see in the unseen.&quot;
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the era orientation and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of becoming a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, let the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times, and the spirit of the nation stimulate each other, so as to provide an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity, national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

When I saw a piece of news about a friend’s stock price, my biggest feeling was the choice of a company’s track record, that is, the choice of an investment target industry. First, it must choose an industry with a large growth potential, with a market size of at least 100 billion or more; secondly, To choose an industry with good growth in the future, consider the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
Tactics lie in &quot;doing the things right&quot;, that is, doing things right.
The strategy lies in &quot;do the right thing&quot;, that is, to do the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding the direction, and tactics lies in landing. Above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or to extend horizontally (strategic thinking); for example, to improve customer retention (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve core customers and high value Customer retention rate (strategic thinking); in addition to improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the correct activity goals, such as increasing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately Pulling in new ones; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.

Asian-American group complains about admissions discrimination at 3 Ivy League schools including Yale - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States submitted complaints to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting against three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College. Discrimination against applicants of Asian descent in the admissions process.
The Asian American Educational Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
The chairman of the group, Zhao Yukong, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of the famous American schools has doubled, but in these three famous American schools, the proportion of Asians has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges have &quot;long-term persistent and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants&quot; in the so-called &quot;comprehensive consideration&quot; admissions process.
Zhao Yukong said that in 2014, a study by Sanders and other scholars showed that in these three colleges and universities, relative to the number of applicants, the admission rate of Asians was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
U.S. Department of Education data also show that of all the Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College admit the lowest percentage of Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants. Up to 20 years or more.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency that they hope that after the complaint is submitted, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice will launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions.
They also expect the colleges and universities complained to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies for Asians.
At present, the three colleges and universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it complained about discrimination in admissions to Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education refused to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, the participants in the complaint also included educational groups of American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani origin.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province from a housing agency. After several on-site viewings, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory building.
In December of the same year, after negotiating with Mr. Lin, a family member of the owner of the house, on the details of purchasing the factory building, Mr. Lu remitted 200,000 yuan via bank transfer on the same day as a deposit.
Lin signed as the payee on the &quot;Factory Buying and Selling Deposit Receipt&quot;, which stated, &quot;If the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will go to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller in double. It is agreed to sign a factory sale contract within a week.&quot;
However, the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, which led to the delay in signing the house sale contract.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
The house that was finally fancy, the deposit was paid, and the house payment was ready, but the contract was signed &quot;at the door&quot;, but the seller did not sell it, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the People&#39;s Court of Yuyao City.
After the trial, the court held that the failure of the two parties to sign a formal contract in the end cannot be solely attributed to the defendant, and it should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the deposit penalty rule should not apply to this case, and the defendant does not need to bear the breach of contract liability of returning double the deposit.
After the judgment of the first instance, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[Lawyer Reminder] In the transaction process, the necessary prudence and care must be fulfilled.
When signing a contract, as a buyer, you must perform the necessary duties of prudence, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied by someone, etc., and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent the performance of the contract. Disputes arose between the two parties.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) After the &quot;Democracy Summit&quot; ended on Friday, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the &quot;Leaders&#39; Democracy Summit&quot; to &quot;draw a line with ideology, Instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, use the name of democracy to act as anti-democracy, instigate division and confrontation, and divert domestic conflicts.&quot;
The Chinese government believes that &quot;for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoted &#39;democratic transformation&#39;, imposed unilateral sanctions indiscriminately, and instigated a &#39;color revolution&#39;, resulting in disastrous consequences.
&#39;Democracy&#39; has long been a &#39;weapon of mass destruction&#39; for US intervention in other countries.
The summit is Biden&#39;s move to deliver on his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was held by videoconference, and the leaders of 111 countries around the world were invited to participate, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States is not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt in the world and in the United States. For example, some leaders who are invited to the meeting with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, are suspected. Some people suspect that the real intention of the Biden administration is not for democracy. The summit was organized for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the video democracy summit
China&#39;s foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday that &quot;today&#39;s American-style democracy is full of pathologies, with money politics, identity politics, political party antagonism, political polarization, social disintegration, racial conflicts, and the polarization between rich and poor becoming more and more serious.&quot; A &quot;rich man&#39;s game&quot; based on capital.
U.S. President Joe Biden said in his speech, &quot;As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to autocratic buffers and shocks. and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good.&quot;
Democracy, he stressed, is not something to be taken for granted, &quot;We have to keep renewing it in every generation, which in my opinion is the defining challenge of our time.&quot;
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights &quot;need champions in the face of persistent and worrying challenges.&quot;
The United States has committed to a year-long campaign following the summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The U.S. wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democracies ahead of a physical democracy summit planned for late 2022.
&quot;Let&#39;s all follow through on our commitments and report next year on the progress we&#39;ve made,&quot; Biden said.
ok, i&#39;m afraid he sent it to the wrong address

Claypot rice is just right in dryness and wetness, and the portion is very generous. The signature tinfoil chicken wings are as good as ever, the soup is also good, and the kale is also handled well...
Good taste, great service, good meat
The old Richang store was also an Internet celebrity many years ago. It is a small building in Dongdan with wooden floors.
It always takes a long time to eat the claypot rice at the door, and the casserole of the claypot rice is cracked...
I haven&#39;t eaten at Richang for several years. The rise of Cantonese cuisine in various small shops has dispersed the passenger flow.
It&#39;s rare to see a seat when you arrive at the store. The quality of the dishes is nothing to say, as good as ever.

What is the drinking method of red label whiskey?
Everyone has different hobbies, some like to collect, some like to gourmet, and of course some like to taste wine. Red Label whiskey is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whiskeys in various countries, and Red Label whiskey has won the gold medal in the International Wine Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don&#39;t know how to taste it, wouldn&#39;t it ruin its mellow aroma.
So how to drink red label whiskey?
Let me give you a brief introduction.
How to drink red label whiskey:
Johnnie Walker Red Label Whiskey is blended from about 35 types of Scotch Whiskey. It has a rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scotch Whiskey, with a sweet and smoky aroma in the rich aroma.
The entrance is rich and fresh, with hints of vanilla and strong smoked malt.
This wine can be served straight over ice, or mixed with your favorite beverage.
Red brand whiskey has entered the country. In order to adapt to the tastes of Chinese people, red brand whiskey + cola, Sprite or Sunkist and other sparkling drinks have become an enduring fashion.
These sweet beverages, in addition to neutralizing the sour taste, can bring pleasure to people visually. Adding beverages can dilute the taste of alcohol and change the taste.
Red brand whiskey + sliced lemon + cube sugar (sugar is also acceptable), is the most authentic and traditional way of drinking.
Authentic Red Fangwei tastes a bit sour, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and lemon will bring a fresh aroma to the wine. Of course, the degree of sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink red brand whiskey. You can try it as a reference. I hope the introduction of the editor can help you.
Thoughts on Education: How the University Examinations Give &quot;Scholars&quot; and &quot;Slags&quot; Their Places - Xinhua English.news.cn
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote letters to the school leaders, expressing their confusion about the university exam, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the exam, change the type of exam questions, and let the exam truly reflect the actual level of the students.
Indeed, university exams have long been a &quot;hot topic&quot;.
On the university campus, students come from all corners of the country, with different abilities and levels. Coupled with different learning levels, the learning situation varies greatly.
It is inevitable to have different feelings about the assessment of a group with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the test questions are single, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who don&#39;t study hard may pass the exam by concentrating on a sudden attack before the exam. If they think of other methods, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there is a &quot;strange situation&quot; that &quot;students&quot; can pass the test without putting in effort, and even get high marks; .
From this point of view, it is not without reason that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reported that there are problems in the university examinations. I believe that this situation is not limited to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise these three students who wrote straight letters.
In fact, anyone who has been to college knows that it is not uncommon to make surprise preparations for the exam, try various methods to &quot;catch&quot; exam questions from the teacher, strive to draw the scope of the exam, and obtain &quot;key tutoring&quot; before the exam. It is not uncommon to have a cheat sheet or ask the teacher to give you a high hand after the exam.
In the author&#39;s opinion, as a teaching quality evaluation guide, the measure of whether a university is qualified or not depends on the teacher&#39;s comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as scientific propositions based on this.
Entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses focus on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether to fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content of the university examination.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and common sense of the subject. From the point of view of knowledge, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, &quot;I learned the basics of college mathematics 20 years ago, and I&#39;m still learning it now, and it&#39;s still the key point.&quot;
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test questions are single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams are generally composed of question groups, and then the senior teachers of the subject coordinate to form the test papers. The examination papers are also marked by all the teachers in charge of the subject, so that the duplication of test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning. The questions are based on the overall situation of students&#39; learning, and the difficulty is normally distributed. The question types are dynamically grasped, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge inspection, but also take into account the ability test, and at the same time carry out innovative design of the question types.
Examinations are the baton of university education. Students will have corresponding preparation plans for what kind of examinations are available. If things go on like this, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the student&#39;s suggestion letter, and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examinations for the end-of-course examinations, formulate test paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and review links, refine the performance evaluation, and strengthen the coordination of all aspects of course teaching. Comprehensive assessment.
Mechanistically solving problems such as single types of test questions and repeated questions is an issue that university examination administration needs to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but the effort is in daily life, and teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation. Not only must they thoroughly understand the teaching content, but also It is even more important to have a thorough understanding of the students&#39; learning situation, so that teaching and learning will be better connected, a positive interaction will be formed, and examinations will be more realistic, so that &quot;student masters&quot; and &quot;students&quot; will have their respective places.

Mrs. Jin Wedding Photography (South Street) There is no branch yet
Because we didn&#39;t arrange the time well before taking the photo, we changed the time twice. The consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, I chose a weekend with good weather to shoot.
Mrs. King&#39;s staff, whether it&#39;s consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are amazing.
It was the first time in my life that I officially wore makeup, wow~ I can&#39;t believe that I will look so good one day, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry I can&#39;t remember the name) are super patient with makeup, and the makeup is very natural.
The location was filmed in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was fine that day, so we didn’t feel very cold. During the photo shoot, the makeup artist kept an eye on our clothes and headgear, and immediately helped us tidy up if there was anything wrong.
The photographer is also very humorous, and I feel very happy after taking pictures all day.
When choosing photos, because I saw many cases on the Internet, I don’t want customers to delete too many photos, but when we choose photos, really, we don’t mean to add photos at all, just 24 photos in the package, one None of them were added (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos at about the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the package of more than 7,000. I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many)
The photo was repaired today, and Lan Lan sent it to me. I saw two of them and thought they were not very good, and they immediately helped me to repair them again.
Compared with the photos my sister took before, I think I am really satisfied with our photos, simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Mrs. Xuanhan Jin to take wedding photos!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful for you and sincerely wishes you happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah do not have birth certificates because special anti-counterfeiting paper is out of stock
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) The Sabah National Registration Department stated that due to the exhaustion of special anti-counterfeit paper stocks, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October. So far, 3,200 people have been affected.
However, Kailu Aminus, director of the Bureau, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system and will be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting paper arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained the 10-month-long report by an online media that there was a problem with the printing of Sabah birth papers.
He said that the problem arose two months ago and Sarawak is also facing the same problem.
&quot;One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, which led to delays in arriving in my country.&quot;
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used in Sabah birth papers is different from other regions, so stocks from other states cannot be borrowed.
Kailu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
&quot;The bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, and return to Sabah for the final stage of printing immediately. It is estimated that it will be delivered to the applicant in two more working days (December 20).&quot;
&quot;We will notify applicants to go to various branch offices to collect their birth certificates.&quot;
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.

Negative nucleic acid within 48 hours, setting up a &quot;buffer zone&quot;, the State Council&#39;s joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document requesting to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic in port cities - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The joint defense and joint control mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring them to leave land border port cities (ports connected to Hong Kong and Macao) in the near future. Except for those) personnel need to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and those who are going to land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame of the above requirements is from the date when the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities determine the scope of port cities and make an announcement, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that qualified port cities can consider setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
The relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission&#39;s Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and border residents on both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of regional differentiated management policies has changed from one line of defense against spillovers to two lines of defense. It is expected to move the gate forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillovers, and achieve the greatest effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the smallest social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been many local clusters of epidemics in my country, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above-mentioned notice pointed out that this exposed the lack of timely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, the failure to implement closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, the regular nucleic acid testing is a mere formality, the elimination of all links of cold chain items is not in place, the management of centralized isolation places is not standardized, and the epidemic emergency Dealing with problems such as insufficient scientific precision.
The notice requires that we focus on nine aspects including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures. , Weave densely to tie up the external defense input defense line.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should conduct simultaneous research and deployment on epidemic prevention and control and people&#39;s livelihood security work, publicize and unblock the people&#39;s livelihood security hotline, regularly investigate potential hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, and promptly solve and proactively respond to complaints from the masses. Outstanding issue.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, prefectures, leagues) and municipalities where open land, water, and air ports are located, and the specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality) Determine and announce in a timely manner according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

YouTube video reveals the truth about 20 years of bloodthirsty killings by the U.S. military - Xinhua English.news.cn
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary titled &quot;Killing Machine&quot; on the Youtube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan under the pretext of &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; and forcibly exporting American democracy through the war. For 20 years, it has been militaristic, bloodthirsty, killing innocent people indiscriminately, and committing various crimes against humanity.
Abuse of drones to bomb hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distort human nature, and set up killing teams.
Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
The U.S. military set up &quot;black prisons&quot; to inflict all kinds of torture and personal humiliation on &quot;suspects&quot;.
A series of crimes against humanity has aroused the hatred of more Afghans.
As the video says, the American-style &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; war &quot;is becoming more and more terrorist&quot;.
The war did not bring hope of peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video, let us expose the truth of bloodthirsty killings in the name of &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; in the United States, and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I accidentally saw the following article, from the perspective of business and shelf life, I talked about why this customer asked the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning. Although canning belongs to deep processing, it does not belong to the business scope of the bonded logistics company. Here is as follows This text might explain why the client would want to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of milk powder in bags and cans are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
Then everyone will definitely ask: why is the shelf life of the bag is one year, but the shelf life of the tin is two years or longer?
Or ask again: Why is there such a big price difference between tinned and bagged?
In fact, starting from this point, many consumers or mothers think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the expensive one is the best.
Some consumers also said that the texture or taste of the canned food is different after eating it out of this mentality!
Now let me tell you the reason why canned packaging is expensive. Where is it expensive?
Why is their price difference so big for the same raw materials?
Because most of the manufacturers consider that if the bag price is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept it, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, so how can the manufacturer survive?
Therefore, they have a large increase in the pricing of cans to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly recommend tinned rather than bagged.
Also, do you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of advertising fees every year, where does this cost come from?
You can imagine.
Then, with the development of society, the marketing expenses of the market, such as: promotional personnel in shopping malls, display expenses in shopping malls, product gift expenses, advertising expenses, etc. are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and the prices of canned products are also constantly rising. In fact, these are new products that come out with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their own products, hook up with doctors in the hospital by any means, and they will assist in the promotion of the products, and a profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan will be drawn from a can.
However, the relevant laws of China absolutely do not allow such methods of operation. In fact, this kind of practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder and put it in the can if you have a can at home, which can save costs, increase the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, and have no impact on children.
Also, don’t think that the shelf life of tinned products is longer than that of bagged products. If the shelf life of tinned products is the same as that of packaged products after opening, it’s just that bagged products are not easy to store after opening and are prone to moisture deterioration.
The delivery was late, the food was cold, it was dry and hard when it was cold, it was totally uneatable

Don&#39;t scare people at the starting line - Xinhua English.news.cn
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of success books.
Many of today&#39;s success books promote the &quot;best principle&quot;-that is, first assume or imply that you can &quot;do it&quot;, and then tell you &quot;what&quot; you need to do.
It is equivalent to saying that the most important and fundamental link of &quot;how to do it&quot; has been skipped at once.
Because of this, these books all have a common feature - either do your best in one go, or don&#39;t do anything at all; either you are 100, or you are 0; wait.
This kind of &quot;best principle&quot; will make everyone admit that it is &quot;incomparably correct&quot;, but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of &quot;you have to make up your mind, start a new life, and make a 180-degree change&quot;, and this is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For a person who sticks to the rules, follows the old ways, and refuses to change, you just want to shout &quot;you want to change&quot; in his ear, which is undoubtedly deceiving yourself and playing the piano against the cow.
The vast majority of people will show timidity before the word &quot;transformation&quot;, hesitate to move forward, and find it difficult to make up their minds; or they make the determination to &quot;transform&quot; on the basis of a momentary impulse, and take the first step bravely, but it is often a good time It&#39;s not long, and if you can&#39;t hold on for a while, you will lose. It&#39;s hard to see continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli&#39;s famous &quot;From Tomorrow&quot; cross talk is the most vivid expression of this &quot;universal human nature&quot; classic.
The biggest problem with the &quot;best principle&quot; is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limit of ordinary people&#39;s ability and makes most people &quot;look at the door and sigh&quot;.
Perhaps, the &quot;second-best principle&quot; is a way that may allow more ordinary people to embark on the path of relative success.
The core of the &quot;second-best principle&quot; lies in &quot;lowering the threshold&quot; - what it encourages is a theory of &quot;accumulating small victories into big victories&quot;, that is, if you can&#39;t achieve 100, you can only achieve 1: because 1 is always greater than 0 ;If you can&#39;t climb Mount Tai, you can just climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because that is always better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than nothing.
Since the threshold is greatly lowered, it is more possible for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as they persist in everything, the probability of success will also increase.
It&#39;s just that the road to success following the &quot;second-best principle&quot; is a little longer.
All in all, although the &quot;best principle&quot; is on the surface under the banner of making everyone successful, it can actually motivate a small number of people in the end; and the &quot;second best principle&quot; can effectively motivate more people, as much as possible. benefit more people.

Reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons compared with the previous year this year, reaching 108,500 tons, which is the same as the previous year. Compared with the initial period of protection in 2002, the cumulative increase has been more than 40 times.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as &quot;Huangyu&quot;, is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the &quot;water-fish-bird&quot; ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to factors such as large-scale human hunting and the degraded environment of the breeding waters of naked carp. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the &quot;Red List of Species in China&quot;.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, measures such as artificial breeding and release, cleaning of the main rivers entering the lake, and the design of scientific and reasonable &quot;fish passages&quot; have continued to increase protection, and the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
According to Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, as of now, nearly 180 million naked carp have been artificially multiplied and released in Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Sanjiangyuan area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in my country and even in Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and an ecological function area to control the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued notices on fishing bans in key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, constructing the &quot;one river, one river, one lake&quot; &quot;Comprehensive fishing ban management system.

Most girls will suddenly experience their first menstruation on a certain day between the ages of 13 and 15, and amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, under the premise of good health, I will come once a month more regularly.
But it is not so regular that it can be accurately predicted. The tolerance of about a week needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes bad luck will overturn the car (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some people have a week; Change, no pain before does not mean no pain for a lifetime.
Menstruation is uncontrollable. I bleed 24 hours from the beginning to the end. The only thing I can do is to suck the blood with sanitary napkins or tampons to prevent it from flowing on the clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Eating ibuprofen before menstruation begins can effectively relieve the pain of the month, but it is useless to eat after dysmenorrhea begins.
Before the menstrual period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If the period is about to come, and there is inexplicable diarrhea, basically menstruation will come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise bacteria will easily grow. Excluding sleep time, the worst case is to change 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add the portion prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces. tablets, not one tablet every month.
(Modify here, the tampon does not need to be changed frequently, it can be changed every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormonal troubles during menstruation may make you irritable, and during ovulation, you will also be emotionally unstable due to hormone changes in your body.
But the official crime rate data shows that women have a high ability to control their emotions, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
It&#39;s not just blood, it&#39;s the sloughed-off endometrium.
The endometrium is the thinnest after menstruation, and then gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house, and the house is built every month (the endometrium thickens) to welcome guests. If the guests do not come, they are all demolished (menstrual discharge) Months to build a new house, again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades, she bleeds 24 hours a day for several days a month, and also suffers from abdominal pain and low back pain. Who wants it?
But a person can be born because his mother has had menstruation. Menstruation is to prepare for the house you will live in for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank your mother for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed. The society brainwashed women to say that they were dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If anyone thinks menstruation is disgusting, and the way a woman&#39;s body prepares for life is disgusting, it shouldn&#39;t be said in public, girls, stand up and stop thinking about it, never experienced it, and never will in this life Men who don&#39;t know much about experience, don&#39;t be so ungrateful and don&#39;t know what is good or bad. How can you face your mother with this attitude, and how can you want your own children?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, it&#39;s really easy to use.
Today is the winter solstice festival, the wrong delivery is disappointing
I want to order another meal for the children
I hope the store will check the products when they are busy.
Is the numb feet in the foot tub a leakage?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a very good role in foot therapy and health care. Today, Gome Xiaobian will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people&#39;s awareness of health care, foot baths are more and more popular with consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged on the market. There are a variety of foot baths ranging from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan, giving consumers There is a lot of room for choice.
According to relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, sales of health care appliances such as foot baths are booming, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety hazards.
&quot;It&#39;s too dangerous to soak your feet in charged water!&quot;
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot tub as a birthday present for his father, but his father felt numbness on the soles of his feet when he soaked his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but unexpectedly, his father still felt numbness on the soles of his feet after turning off the vibration function.
Mr. Li tried it with an electric pen, and the electric pen turned on. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot tub was charged.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the attitude of the merchant was not bad. Even though he returned the foot tub, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that this foot tub, which has been popular for a long time, does not have a clear and detailed industry regulation on the setting of the highest temperature, what kind of people it is suitable for, and what kind of materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
However, under normal circumstances, the foot bath will not have the problem of electrification, but it does not rule out that a few products are not strictly checked when they leave the factory.
Therefore, choose a split foot tub when purchasing.
Water and electricity are separated without any safety hazard.
At the same time, you can take the electric pen to test at will.

Ding Zilin: To my friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all my friends for your humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after our relatives were killed, especially since I issued an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in my own name in early 1994, the uninterrupted appeal so far Rescue.
Nowadays, most of the parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up, married and employed.
It is your righteous deeds that have helped our suffering families through the most difficult time.
At present, the new crown epidemic is raging around the world, and most of the donors have also retired.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to stop making humanitarian donations to our family members—the Tiananmen Mothers. This humanitarian rescue activity should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Ye Note: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance of the IFCSS and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian assistance, the IFCSS and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the executors of the projects often overlap.

Relief funds are often not successfully delivered to the victims of June 4th.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Jing Ding, the &quot;Tiananmen Mothers&quot; set up a special group to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the &quot;June 4th Orphans Education Fund&quot;. After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from college, MCDF set up the &quot;June 4th Orphan Elderly Relief Fund for Extremely Poor Households&quot;, which has been implemented until now .
The funds for these projects mainly come from campus and social donations in the June 4th year, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Democracy Foundation of Brother University.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Laogai Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the families of the June Fourth victims finally received a part of the donations raised in the name of June Fourth from Hong Kong.
During this period, Human Rights in China also carried out their humanitarian relief projects independently.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped the June 4th donation for the sake of the donors. We are indeed some retired elderly people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter &quot;to friends&quot;.
We will respect the families&#39; decision to terminate the program within two years and, if necessary, resume it immediately.
I would also like to express my gratitude and respect to those heroic comrades who have persisted in giving generously and risking humanitarian relief funds for many years.

Thank you Rabbit for your comment. I originally said that rejecting Gufeng is not suitable for Gufeng. I didn’t expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you Dandan for your approval, your satisfaction can make us fully charged and continue to move forward, we will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great and highly recommend to all friends!
Everything from reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography to post-production is impeccable.
The makeup artist is very delicate, and will match your makeup according to your style, and the cosmetics used are all first-line big brands.
Not to mention Teacher Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens playing with them.
We work in Beijing, and the better photo studios in Beijing have to line up half a year in advance. My colleagues filmed in Beijing, and after watching the finished film, I think it is just so so.
I specifically searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor. I think this is also a short version of most people. The photographer Liang will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post design, an excellent team.
When it came out, we and the people around us were full of praise.
I have already recommended my best friend to go there, and my best friend is also full of joy after seeing the negatives.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, and more people will discover ta, and shoot out their own style, instead of being stereotyped.
Thank you very much for Zhan Ying and Jing Ling&#39;s five-star reviews. Both are very thoughtful and creative newcomers. We are a creative studio. As long as customers like it, we will do our best to complete it. Thank you for getting to know each other.
Sweet and caring assistants, as well as a lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shoot, an unforgettable experience, and the effect of the shoot was much better than I expected. Everyone has worked hard, very much Thank you everyone 😘😘
Thank you Xiaoyu for your comments. Knowing you is also a kind of fate. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust in us is thousands of kilometers away. I am very happy to meet you. I will come to Qinhuangdao next time if I have the opportunity.

A programming novice who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don&#39;t have this idea, it&#39;s better to learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you plan to enter the industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to study by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, it depends on the teaching staff of this institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, this training institution will be meaningless. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong teaching staff.
Secondly, inquire about this training institution before choosing. It is best to inquire about the students who come out of this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like and whether the courses explained are good or not.
Hello, in fact, I don’t know how to answer your question, because I haven’t given a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, all of these will be related to the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or have graduated from a major in computer science, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the lowest efficiency and cost. Many offline and online training institutions are actually very good. , but first, the cost of learning is high, and second, it takes a lot of time. Basically, intensive training is required for 3-6 months.
But if it is the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are many training resources on station b. If you don’t know how to find resources, you can also contact them through the profile Contact me for free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to study, so that learning will not be very strenuous, the teacher will explain in detail, and there will be dedicated answers to questions. In addition, in the study plan Or supervision can help too.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements and have internal referral quotas. After learning, they recommend to go to the company, so that the interview process of job hunting can save a lot of trouble.
The above are some of my opinions. Because I don’t know your situation, I only introduce it in general and not in detail. If you have other questions, you can contact me at any time for communication.

The plan of a day lies in the morning, and all the good things start in the morning. I hope you start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and wishfulness, and keep a good mood throughout the day. Good morning
When I was young, happiness was a thing, and when I had it, I was happy; when I grew up, happiness was a goal, and when I reached it, I was happy; when I matured, I found that happiness was originally a state of mind, and when I realized it, I was happy.
Be the truest and kindest self, act according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; one way in life, follow your own way; two treasures in life: a good body, a good mood, and a beautiful life to old age!
Every stage of life will encounter different problems.
In many cases, it is not your ability that constrains you, but the courage to face it positively.
Since it cannot be avoided, it is better to face it calmly.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you face up to difficulties, the problems will eventually be solved.
Curators from China and Saudi Arabia jointly hold the first Saudi Contemporary Art Biennale - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) The first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, was held on the 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. Officially open to the public, a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition.
The Biennale is co-planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Philip Tinari, Director of UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, serving as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is &quot;Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones&quot;, which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabia&#39;s social and cultural development.
This Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters. The exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: &quot;Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones&quot; &quot;Inheritance as an Experiment&quot; &quot;Thinking on the Edge&quot; &quot;Going to the Public&quot; &quot;Beauty&quot; New World&quot; and &quot;On the Spirit of Art&quot;.
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation art and performance art; the works of 12 Chinese artists also attracted much attention, and some artists used novel For example, Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting with waste in &quot;The Story Behind the Series: Endless Pictures of Streams and Mountains&quot; (2014).
Barkley, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that this biennale can establish an international dialogue, giving global audiences the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia&#39;s thriving cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction.
Philip Tinari said: &quot;The goal of the Biennale is two-fold, to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, and to allow Saudi audiences to integrate into the contemporary art world.&quot;
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the Biennale, where artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinating and regulating the management of public welfare posts in rural areas - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in providing employment assistance for those who have been lifted out of poverty, and to consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently introduced policies to promote rural revitalization and rural public welfare post management to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Human Resources and Social Security Department of Yunnan Province, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare jobs, which are used to provide employment for poverty-stricken labor groups and other rural groups. It plays an important role in various public service capabilities.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance.
In terms of post development and setting, the new regulations are clear, in accordance with &quot;according to the needs of the post, fixed people according to the post, dynamic management, total amount control&quot;, &quot;who develops, who uses, who is responsible&quot; and &quot;one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, unified management &quot;The principle is set.
Recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training, and job placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that each rural public welfare post development department should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare post placement personnel ; Relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the distribution of rural public welfare post subsidies.

Hello
Can I cancel the order
I re-order
Is it cancelled?
2. Although the rightists have a successful period in history, but it is not long, so the shortcoming is because they will shine when given some sunshine, and sweat when they drink some boiled water;
But to be honest, rightists have played an active role in the process of social progress.
From the aspects of ending the Cultural Revolution to defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong’s statements, I am very concerned about what he said, and I respect Li Weidong a lot; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also serious about China’s social problems. Take it seriously.
But I am opposed to his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, damage to people&#39;s livelihood, political groups mixed with fish and dragons, and foreign countries to take advantage of it.
4. To change or improve China&#39;s attitude of being patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to profit from the fire by political speculation are not rightists, but bastards.
Let&#39;s talk about left.
The left is actually a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some right speeches and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left will not have such good luck, because what the left wants is the dross that the Communist Party throws away!
5. Recently, I saw some friends refute Zuodian while criticizing the thieves, and I was really angry. I don&#39;t think there is any need for it.
Don&#39;t try to reason with traitors and Zuo epilepsy, they are all one-sided and unreasonable.
Don&#39;t try to prove that we are right, let alone get the rebels and Zuodian to admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this way: When the rebel scolds you for five cents, and when the leftist scolds you for being a dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget their ideals, or pursue their ideals, but become paranoid.
Gradually drifting away from his ideals, even the young dragon slayer eventually became a dragon.
I think left and right generally refer to restraint and freedom. China&#39;s innate genes from history and culture have led to China as a whole being left-leaning.
In China, the rightists are free and focus on efficiency and development, while the leftists strengthen supervision and pay more attention to fairness and safety.
Now the general society hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, China and the United States are fighting each other. It is certain that they will lean to the left, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don&#39;t understand it, just like it and it&#39;s over
Don&#39;t say anything, Huahua is so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and siege of Huawei chips by the U.S. imperialists not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to &quot;U.S.-based&quot; companies.
The U.S. imperialism suppresses China&#39;s chip industry and requires its own companies and related companies in allied countries to block my country&#39;s chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in reduced R&amp;D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers. , thus causing a shortage of chip supply chains around the world.
Today, the &quot;chip shortage&quot; has spread to major industries around the world, such as the suspension of production by car companies and the price increase of mobile phones. Almost all industries that use chips have suffered greatly.
In order to master the autonomy of &quot;chips&quot;, technology giants in more and more countries have begun to &quot;de-beautify&quot; the road.
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China&#39;s semiconductor industry, Laomei has made frequent moves recently, hosting the &quot;chip summit&quot;; inviting giants from 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, and allocating funds to support local American technology giants, For example, in order to regain its dominance in the chip field, Intel, a veteran U.S. technology giant, invested $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and opened up its chip foundry business to the outside world.
Most people think that Intel&#39;s move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to take away TSMC&#39;s &quot;job&quot;.
The reason for this certainty is that Intel, as a veteran technology giant in the United States, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large talent team and technical reserves. It will surely rise rapidly in a short period of time and defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of TSMC, dismissed Intel&#39;s decision.
At the &quot;2021 Master Think Tank Forum&quot; held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement. Regarding Intel&#39;s move to invest in building a fab, Zhang Zhongmou had no scruples and said bluntly: Intel&#39;s building a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel&#39;s entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still has a grudge against TSMC and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the jewel in the manufacturing industry of the United States, ranking at the top of the world, and is the overlord of the world&#39;s semiconductor field.
Until the 1980s, the world&#39;s high-end semiconductor chips had been controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. Chip design, manufacturing, packaging and testing were all completed by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model has overwhelmed some small companies, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only hold back in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to see the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design. in wafer fabrication plants.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou&#39;s vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC focuses its main business on the single link of &quot;wafer processing&quot;, does not design, and only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just established at that time, was a small guy in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once approached Intel for investment, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing of the chip industry, it was obvious that Intel had a high opinion of itself, looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then are now starting to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel&#39;s entry into the foundry was ironic.
Today, TSMC&#39;s market capitalization has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC&#39;s strong attack, Intel naturally did not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.

Let&#39;s take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: the rise of Erlong in February, the price increase of Haoliyou, and the Lala incident. The spread of public opinion forms a peak, and then [exponential decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipates. If secondary public opinion occurs, a small hump will appear again .
They look the same as the [Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model] displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches in the same event, presenting [lonely], [jagged], [cliff].
[Lonely peak shape] means artificial heating, quickly hit the hot search list, attracting public attention; [Jagged shape] means periodic heating to ensure that the topic is entrenched in the hot search list; functions”, receive new missions and rush to new battlefields.
In Figure 9, the crest of one event’s popularity coincides with the trough of another event, and the time is exactly the same. It must be that the same group of naval forces received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for science popularization, which ones lead to wars, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgments, which ones incite emotions, and which ones coerce decision-making , Black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for refined operations, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Putting aside all subjective factors such as position and emotion, black public relations will have nowhere to hide from only objective data.
Anyone who walks will leave traces, and we will dig out such traces together.

Mauritius and other countries discover first cases of Omicron strain infection - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th reports from Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported for the first time the discovery of cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant Omicron strain.
On the 10th, Mauritius reported for the first time two cases of Omicron strain infection in the country.
According to Mauritius Minister of Health Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; The nucleic acid test was positive on November 30 after contact with a person who returned from South Africa.

The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed the first 3 cases of Omicron strain infection.
These three people are all students. They returned from a trip abroad earlier this month. Since they were all mild, they were not admitted to the hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Serbian government has continuously stepped up prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter the country by air will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health of Serbia also announced on the 10th that it will begin to vaccinate children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawi&#39;s Minister of Health, Kumbize Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country had discovered three cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time.
The country&#39;s health department carried out genome sequencing on 12 new crown positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and discovered these three cases of infection.

At first, it was recommended by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look. At first, my budget was 70,000 yuan for basic decoration.
When I came to the store, a series of deceptions began.
I went to the store for the first time and just showed them my floor plan. They didn&#39;t go to the site to measure the house. They were able to give me a quotation saying that my 1.35 house can be settled at 70,000 yuan. Give me a rough estimate. After looking at their materials, I don&#39;t know what brand of materials they are.
Their second set of tricks is that as long as you arrive at the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and once you pay the money, you will never get it back, unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you as long as you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit. I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan.
The quotation he gave me had a lot of problems. The 70,000 yuan did not include water and electricity renovations, and did not include any doors and cabinet bathrooms, and these three were the bulk of the cost of the basic installation.
Apart from these, their service point charges are higher than other companies.
I lost trust in this company and asked me to sign a contract without explaining anything clearly at first.
When I went to them to get my money back they acted very experienced and have a small team to deal with you.
It&#39;s the customer&#39;s fault that they will bite to death anyway and they are totally not responsible.
All kinds of shirk responsibility, there are a lot of details, I don’t want to talk about them all, but don’t choose them, because the house my friend asked them to decorate is also of poor quality, and I will calculate various expenses for you later.
Pit father, they are the original deceitful faucet decorations, now they are changed to Damei, it seems that they have closed down again and changed to others.
So don&#39;t choose such a cheating decoration company.
In the future, when you choose, you can check these on Baidu and check these consultations, because decoration is not a small amount of money.
If you want to ask questions to merchants, please log in or register first

It&#39;s so scary, please cancel the order if you don&#39;t arrive within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? Like, change address?
Okay, then don&#39;t cancel this conversation. If I don&#39;t refund my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it is possible to cancel within 15 minutes

A date in the starry sky丨Geminids meteor shower ushers in maximum on 14th - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomy science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in its peak on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers Observations can be made later in the night.
The Geminid meteor shower was taken in Qinghai on December 13, 2018 by Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu.
The parent celestial body of most meteor showers is a periodic comet, but the parent celestial body of the Geminid meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not &quot;conceived&quot; by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, a director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomy science popularization, said that just like blockbusters for the New Year, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the &quot;release schedule&quot; can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is famous for its large and stable flow, and together with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is called the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteoroids are slow in speed, rich in color, and there are many fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and beginners in astrophotography.
The Geminid meteor shower was taken by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year&#39;s Geminid meteor shower will usher in its maximum around 15:00 on December 14th, and the maximum ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, when the radiant point is directly above the head, the number of meteors that can be seen per hour) for 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommendation index chart.
&quot;Last year, the Geminid meteor shower of &#39;Falling Flowers&#39; left a deep impression on people, but this year&#39;s Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by the moonlight, and the excitement will be a little bit compromised.
The 14th is November 11th of the lunar calendar, and the moon phase is waxing and gibbous. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will rise relatively high at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the hours when the moon is behind in the second half of the night, but pay attention to keeping warm from the cold. &quot;
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
&quot;It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view facing the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently for the moon to set before visual observation.
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don&#39;t have to keep staring at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography want to shoot gorgeous &#39;meteor shower blockbusters&#39;, it is best to choose a wide-angle lens with a large aperture, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and continuity considerations, tripods, spare batteries and shutter cables are also essential. &quot;
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference in market positioning between laser TV and traditional TV?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TV itself is a product born for large screens.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales volume of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CMM&#39;s forecast, in 2020, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
China Electronics Standardization Institute Saixi Laboratory and Peking Union Medical College Hospital ophthalmology experts obtained 144 sets of test data through strict comparative tests of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data proves that laser TV does have strong eye protection properties, and even has a certain improvement in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is getting more and more attention, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its advantages of eye protection, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous drop in the price of LCD TVs, the current prices of laser TVs on the market are mostly more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price is gradually rising.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
Certainly makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technical levels, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projections cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can realize a 100-inch large-screen experience within a short distance.
In terms of brightness, big-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
Not to mention pseudo-demand, but a product of subdivided demand. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has pros and cons. After weighing You can judge for yourself, and you are afraid of listening to one-sided words.
To put it simply, in order to get close to the screen, ultra-wide-angle and close-focus projectors, laser TVs, have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors, which do not conform to the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, a Fresnel screen with a microstructure is used, which is expensive, and the price of an 80-inch LCD can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another point is that I really hate that projection manufacturers use diffuse reflection as a selling point that is good for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light to the eyes. If you diffuse reflection on the ceiling, the eyes can&#39;t see it. It turns out that if you want to be more realistic, the LCD TV is also &quot;directly illuminated&quot;. Isn&#39;t the ceiling also illuminated when the TV is turned on?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse, it will not be able to form an image at all.
It is precisely the hot spot (spot) effect of the high-gain screen that is ignored, and a large amount of light reflected from a certain angle to the eyes is really uncomfortable.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio has no branches for the time being
Added the WeChat appointment date, and the young lady sent me the optional schedule, and the reply was more timely~
Before I went, I saw the photos taken in the store, most of them were outdoor wedding dresses, the photos were very beautiful, and there were many shooting styles involved.
When the day arrived, I briefly exchanged my thoughts with the young lady, and patiently helped me try on two sets of clothes that I was struggling with, and finally decided to start makeup and styling~ The photographer will place some props before shooting, guide the action, and pay attention to every detail It is also more refined.
But it may be because I didn’t communicate with me about the specific shooting ideas, so the shot is not the style I want, but it should be good-looking🙊🙊
After the shooting is finished, the photographer will help to select the photos and communicate the post-production style. I feel very careful.
It will take about half a month to repair the film, just wait for the effect~
The second time I won the overlord meal event of the photo category ~ most of the clothes in the audience can choose one piece for shooting.
Finally, I chose a black gauze skirt to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting is a younger brother born in 1995. I feel a little bit young. I hope that I can give more advice on the direction of customer shooting actions in the future~ I am very talkative Yes, the shooting process was more enjoyable.
Reply from Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery Premium Quality Store
It’s on the homepage, let’s take a look at Queenie too~
When I arrived at the store, I first filled in my name and phone number and then chose the clothes. I could choose any wedding dress. I was quite patient after changing three or four sets of clothes. When it came out, it felt like a big face. The intensive editing said that it would take half a month, and it was sent in three or four days. It felt like it was no different from the original film.
[Environment] The overall situation is fine.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are almost three places for makeup, and the inside is a studio.
[Service] Very enthusiastic and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the movements very seriously.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will take the initiative to offer a reshoot.
[Experience] Maybe the shape is a bit too much, the original double eyelids were pasted with triple eyelids.
The end of eyebrows has also been shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for those who don&#39;t use thrush every day.
The photos have been given in about ten days, but the effect of the P pictures is not very satisfactory. I feel that the double eyelids are still very obvious.
Because I don’t know what style I want, I tried two sets, but I still chose the black dress. The lady said that this set is more Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to make up my hair. The hair stylist and makeup artist are very patient in helping me. I am very satisfied with the result.
After I finished my makeup and hair, I started to take pictures. The photographer instructed me to pose during the whole process.
After the filming, I carefully selected four favorite photos for refinement. The little brother said that he was very satisfied with the ending of the film within 15~
It&#39;s been 3 days with no reply... I can&#39;t join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan because your system doesn&#39;t recognize my credit card!
The weirdest thing is that I pay with the same credit card every time
I now have to pay for shipping every time
It can be exempted first, and my monthly fee will be charged after you finish the investigation, is that okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of the setting conditions: According to the &quot;Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)&quot;, to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders, promoters have no major violation records in the last 3 years, and the minimum limit It can only be established if it is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three items are actually very harsh. To sum up, they must be strong, and must be approved by the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and banks across the country). Shareholders must have a good style of work. Therefore, the policyholder does not need to question too much whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, and not all insurance companies can meet them.
At this point, it&#39;s not bad, it&#39;s trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies’ star critical illness insurances are sold on this platform, such as the latest Hetai Super Mario No. 5 critical illness insurance. Hetai Life Insurance and Small Umbrella Insurance are just third-party intermediaries, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the point of view of the payment mode: Internet platform products are generally cost-effective because they reduce the operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of salesperson wages, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, which reduces the pressure on policyholders. , and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
Can consider it.
From the point of view of the professionalism of the salesperson: this is particularly important, because insurance is an industry that requires a very strong professionalism, and many Internet product customers can insure themselves, which will cause many misunderstandings. In terms of health notification and occupation, Non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective awareness when applying for insurance, thinking that they are healthy or eligible, so there are likely to be many hidden dangers in claim settlement and the risk of being rejected.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing at &quot;Tencent Micro Insurance&quot; (an Internet insurance brokerage platform like Little Umbrella), and I am very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, but it is people who are unreliable. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are many misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance guarantees 6 million, buy insurance to get a mobile phone, and receive 60,000 critical illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important and ignore the trivial. They will not tell the policyholder that the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month needs to be as normal The fee ranges from tens to 200. Many customers deduct fees for one or two years and they don&#39;t know what they bought.
Thinking that you can spend 1 yuan, the insurance company will pay 6 million (the world will lose the pie).
The free mobile phone is only given for special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, I will not redeem it, and no one will remind me.
(This is another pitfall for policyholders.) It is short-term to receive 60,000 critical illness insurance for free. If you only rely on this and no other commercial insurance, in case of a serious illness, what can you do with 60,000 yuan? There is no problem, and the rest of my life will start to run naked.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So on the whole, there is no problem with the platform, and there is no problem with the product. The problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the subject should consider it comprehensively. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are more cost-effective than Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products, and each person saved 2,000-3,000 yuan/year in insurance premiums.
If you have any questions, welcome to communicate and communicate with me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker, I have 3 years of experience in corporate management training, served nearly a thousand corporate users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before applying for insurance, I will start from the needs of customers and customize insurance products for customers. During insurance application, we shop around for customers and try our best to obtain the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance application, we arrange and entrust policy documents for customers, so that customers can rest assured.
Lifelong growth with each customer.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the owner of the topic!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance procedures independently after clicking the insurance application link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the policyholder independently.
Although Internet insurance is not very &quot;ceremonial&quot; and may not even have a printed version of the paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract in the slightest.
This model is a bit similar to the general assembly line operation of &quot;telephone sales&quot;, but there is also a fatal problem in purchasing insurance in this way, that is-the follow-up service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the &quot;intermediary&quot; we choose can be with us for a long time, and after many years What about &quot;insurance intermediaries&quot; who also provide us with services?

thank you for your help
From before to now, I am opposed to any form of slander and abuse, let alone accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to this villain.
If you don&#39;t look at political parties and factions, you must first resist this uncivilized style of work.
From your Facebook friend requests, to your sarcastic posts, to your attempts to post your so-called home location and father&#39;s name on social media, I have taken a non-responsive attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me with the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as appearance, figure, good fertility, and what Leave a message about planting strawberries on the bed, whether to insert them, etc., I... forget it.
How did I know that later on I received more than one friend’s comments about uploading a photo of you on your Facebook friend account and sexually harassing comments.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After the news that I called the police was uploaded, you didn&#39;t restrain yourself at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don&#39;t care what your political background is, and no matter what your status is, in our society, both genders need to be respected.
Yes, you can continue to make sarcastic, veiled, humiliating, and abusive remarks, you can also continue to say that you just love and pay attention to me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it was not made by you pictures or continue to make all offensive remarks.
That&#39;s right, I can&#39;t and I don&#39;t have the ability to stop you.
I neither know you, nor want to know you, and my appearance and figure don&#39;t need your judgment.
I don&#39;t even think any girl would want to be so humiliated in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, are you okay?
I said yes, you won&#39;t believe it.
I don&#39;t think any girl can say she&#39;s okay after being bullied like that.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic morals will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart.
I cut some messages for you to comment on
If you post yourself, no one can impersonate you, right?
All I can say is that you are the enemy of civilization.

Three U.S. aircraft carriers build up the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visit Guam One of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy&#39;s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to U.S. allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank &quot;South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform&quot;, on January 9, satellites spotted the USS Carl Vinson (USS Carl Vinson) aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform predicts that the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; will go to the South China Sea for deployment.
This is the first time that the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; aircraft carrier has been deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 &quot;Osprey&quot; carrier-based transport aircraft.
The U.S. aircraft carriers currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;, also have the &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; aircraft carrier that departed from the United States on January 3.
The &quot;Lincoln&quot; also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the U.S. Navy currently deploys in the Asia-Pacific region is the &quot;USS Ronald Reagan&quot; aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the guided missile cruiser &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; and the guided missile destroyer &quot;Stockdale&quot;.
Three U.S. Aircraft Carriers Gather the Most Powerful Weapons Around China and Rarely Visit Guam On January 17, 2022, the &quot;South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform&quot; released the latest satellite images showing that three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo@南海技术situational awareness) The three U.S. aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visit Guam. On January 17, 2022, the flight path of the U.S. carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(微博@南海技术situational awareness) According to a CNN report on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal paid a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine &quot;USS Nevada&quot; carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads sailed into the U.S. Naval Base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three aircraft carriers of the United States gathered the most powerful weapons around China and made a rare visit to Guam. According to analysis, this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
It was the first visit by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China&#39;s Yongshu Island in the Spratly Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy stated in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam has strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating the capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and Ongoing commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as &quot;Boomer submarines&quot;.
The whereabouts of the 14 Thunder Submarines in the U.S. Navy fleet are generally kept strictly secret.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thundering Submarine the &quot;most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad,&quot; which also includes siled ballistic missiles in the continental United States and nuclear-capable warheads such as the B-2 and B-52 bomber.
Chatting with a friend recently, Meta has plummeted by 26%, and its market value has evaporated by 251 billion U.S. dollars. Zuckerberg responded that he &quot;faces unprecedented competition.&quot; What is the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its income mainly comes from advertising. Advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are Meta traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest &quot;advertising network&quot;. Many Apps are connected to Meta&#39;s advertisements, and Meta&#39;s advertising platform is used to realize monetization.
However, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple&#39;s privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple&#39;s current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow the App to obtain their own information. The normal reaction of most people is definitely not to allow it.
Next, if Google stabs again, the impact on Meta&#39;s revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in previous Meta revenue growth has also been weakened (the proportion of this factor is not sure how high it is, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta&#39;s revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by Chinese companies doing overseas business.
Meta&#39;s office in Hong Kong has about a few hundred people, and there are several major agents in the mainland.
When Chinese companies want to expand into overseas markets, Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte&#39;s TT is now one of Meta&#39;s main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte in the past two years.
Various agents in China are helping Byte to advertise on Meta, and Meta’s performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven&#39;t looked into it specifically recently, but it certainly won&#39;t be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting old, and new platforms including TT are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem isn&#39;t just declining revenue, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only focused on income, but more importantly, what is expected in the future.
Clearly, Meta&#39;s expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story for the market, Zuckerberg told the &quot;Metaverse&quot;.
The metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization period of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the past two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Don’t look at Facebook’s current prosperity, which has an annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars. In fact, Facebook has a strong sense of crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, it does not have any good security moat.
Although several of his social software now have a relatively high daily activity and are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook does not have much confidence, and the subversion is just a blink of an eye.
However, the elusive concept of creating the metaverse has no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company again, and kept looking for it. The root cause of the new track, but I think his track choice is wrong and a road of no return. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
